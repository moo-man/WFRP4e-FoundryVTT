This trigger is the same as [Pre-Roll Test](./preRollTest), except it only runs for trait Tests. Additionally, if an effect is owned by a trait and designated as an `Item` Document Type effect, scripts with this trigger will only run when that specific trait is rolled.

If you want to add modifiers to the Test target or SL, you should use the [Dialog](./dialog.md) trigger.
