This trigger is the same as [Pre-Roll Test](./preRollTest), except it only runs for weapon Tests. Additionally, if an effect is owned by a weapon and designated as an `Item` Document Type effect, scripts with this trigger will only run when that specific weapon is rolled. 

{: .important}
If you want to add modifiers to the Test target or SL, you should use the [Dialog](./dialog.md) trigger.
