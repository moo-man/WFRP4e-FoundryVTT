# Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a list of questions new users might often raise as they explore the system


## General

{: .question}
Something is wrong! What do I do?

This depends on what the problem is exactly! See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).

{: .question}
I bought this but I don't see any content!

See the page on [Buying, Registering, Installing, and Activating Premium Content](./premium)

## Character Creation

{: .question}
Why aren't both Gnomes and Ogres showing up in Character Creation when I have both modules that add them? How can I get them both available?

Well, the simple answer is that no book/module has ever defined a table that has both Gnomes and Ogres on it, but you can always make your own or modify the existing one. Either duplicate or create a new Rollable Table (make sure it has the `key` of `species`, at the top of the table sheet), add the Species you want, and select the table to be used for Character Creation. You can select the specific species table to use for Character Creation from **Configure Settings** -> **System Settings** -> **Table settings**.

{: .question}
How can I create a new Species for Character Creation?

See [Creating a new Species]()

## Usage

{: .question}
None of my Talent bonuses show up in the roll dialog anymore!

It sounds like you are using old Talents from before the [Effect Refactor](./effects//effect-refactor). See the section on [how to utilize the new effects](./effects//effect-refactor#tldr-what-should-i-do-so-my-game-doesnt-break)

## Modules

{: .question}
How can I print the WFRP character sheets for my players?

[This module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e-actor-sheet-print) is built specifially for converting WFRP sheets to PDF. Whether or not it is currently updated and usable, I cannot confirm.
