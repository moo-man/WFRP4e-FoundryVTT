# Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a list of questions new users might often raise as they explore the system


## General

{: .question}
Something is wrong! What do I do?

This depends on what the problem is exactly! See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).

{: .question}
I bought this but I don't see any content!

See the page on [Buying, Registering, Installing, and Activating Premium Content](./premium)

## Character Creation

{: .question}
How can I include Gnomes or Ogres in character creation?

You need to tell the system what Table to use during character generation. This can be done via **Configure Settings** -> **System Settings** -> **Table settings**.

{: .question}
Why aren't both Gnomes and Ogres showing up in Character Creation when I have both modules that add them? How can I get them both available?

Well, the simple answer is that no book/module has ever defined a table that has both Gnomes and Ogres on it, but you can always make your own or modify the existing one. Either duplicate or create a new Rollable Table (make sure it has the `key` of `species`, at the top of the table sheet), add the Species you want, and select the table to be used for Character Creation, as described above.

{: .question}
How can I create a new Species for Character Creation?

See [Creating a new Species]()

## Usage

{: .question}
How do I create new Careers?

There is nothing more special about creating a Career than any other Item. See the [Foundry Knowledge Base Article](https://foundryvtt.com/article/items/). Additionally, see [Careers](./basics/careers.md) for more information on how Careers work.

{: .question}
I'm trying to change the Token size for an Actor, but it keeps reverting!

See the [Actor Settings](./basics/basics.md#actor-settings) menu for how to disable certain automatic behaviors.

{: .question}
Why can't Players see the rolled number and target number when I (the GM) roll Tests?

## Modules

{: .question}
How can I print the WFRP character sheets for my players?

[This module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e-actor-sheet-print) is built specifially for converting WFRP sheets to PDF. Whether or not it is currently updated and usable, I cannot confirm.
