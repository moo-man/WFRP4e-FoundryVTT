# Recommended Modules

I am new to Foundry VTT and/or the WFRP4e game system. What are the best/recommended modules I should install?
{: .question}

**Answer:** None.

---

Modules can greatly enhance your Foundry VTT experience—but there’s no universal “best” list. Here’s why:
* **Foundry, WFRP4e, and modules change often.** — Static lists quickly become outdated. Some modules stop being maintained or get replaced by built-in features. Using old lists can cause major issues.
* **Needs and preferences vary.** — Some GMs want automation, others prefer manual control. A popular module might not suit your style – or you might forget to use it, turning it into unnecessary bloat.
* **Modules can conflict.** — Especially ones that overhaul similar systems, like dice rolling or chat cards. Be cautious when combining such modules.
* **Don’t install everything at once.** — It’s tempting, but overwhelming. You’ll struggle to tell which module does what. Add one at a time, read the docs, and test it.
* **Know core Foundry and WFRP4e first.** — Start with few or no modules. You might like the built-in tools better, and you’ll better understand what modules are changing.

Instead of following big lists, identify specific needs or pain points in your game—then look for modules that solve those. Add them slowly and intentionally.
