This module is a collection of custom trappings and features for WFRP4e. Forien's Armoury started as a compendium of my own custom items and houserules and as the time went by, it got expanded.

- It boasts a vast collection of automated features, from new Item types (Grimoires and Magic Scrolls), through
  Automated Disease/Injury Progression, to Combat and Casting Fatigue.
- It contains 24 Macros for both Players and GMs, including checking Career Progress, Repairing Items,
  Awarding XP (with Companions), creating Spell Ingredients etc.
- It contains over 150 Items, including 22 Spells, 16 Careers, 13 Talents, 24 Templates, and a lot of Trappings, Traits etc.
- Journals are provided, describing every feature, homebrew rule, and content in the Module.
