{: .warning}
> Do you have an **immediate/time sensitive** problem (e.g. you're in the middle of a session and you need help)? Your best course of action is to **join a Discord and ask the question there**. The solutions below will not have a quick response time and are not very suitable for back-and-forth troubleshooting.  
>
> [FoundryVTT Discord (recommended)]() - Describe your problem in the `#warhammer` channel for support.  
> [Moohammer Discord]() - Describe your problem in the `#wfrp` channel for support.  
> [Rat Catcher's Guild Discord]() - Describe your problem in the `#the-foundry-vtt` channel for support.  
>
> *Even so, there might simply not be anyone online that can help. You can also send a message to me directly on Discord (`moo.man`), and I will try to help if I am available.*
