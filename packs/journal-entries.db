{"_id":"01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl","name":"Fate and Resilience","content":"<p>Whether it’s guts, luck or the favour of the gods, there is something special about you. Fate and Resilience represent the different ways you stand out from the masses. </p>\n<p>Characters gain their starting Fate and Resilience in Character Generation. Both are related to pools of points: Fate to Fortune, Resilience to Resolve. You may spend your points to achieve small benefits, and these pools will refill over the course of play. You spend your Fate or Resilience points for a significant benefit during play but this permanently reduces them and also reduces the associated pool of Fortune or Resolve points. While Fate and Resilience points may be regained, this occurs only rarely, so spend them carefully. </p>\n<p>Although they are very rare and normally reserved for PCs, the GM may also want to apply Fate and Resilience to noteworthy NPCs, like a necromantic nemesis, a local luminary of significance, or a recurring cult leader.</p>\n<h3>Fate and Fortune</h3>\n<p>Player characters have destiny. While their ultimate future is a mystery and there is no guarantee it will be glorious, heroic, or even pleasant, they are seemingly fated for something important.</p>\n<p>To represent this, you begin play with a number of Fate Points. Fate points mark you out from the rest of the denizens of the Old World. They allow you to survive against impossible odds and prevail where ordinary folk fail.</p>\n<p>Fate is directly related to your Fortune points. Fortune points are spent to receive minor bonuses, including the ability to reroll failed Tests or gain an edge as luck favours you, and the number you have will likely fluctuate wildly during play. Fate determines how many Fortune points you can have, and be permanently spent in the direst of circumstances to avoid death.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Fortune</h4>\n<p>You may spend a Fortune point from your pool to turn luck to your advantage: hitting with that difficult crossbow shot when you would have otherwise missed; or perhaps an opponent slips, granting you a chance to land a blow. Your three options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reroll a failed Test</li>\n<li>Add +1 SL to a Test after it is rolled</li>\n<li>At the start of the Round, choose when to act in that Round disregarding Initiative order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Fate </h4>\n<p>You may spend a permanent Fate point to avoid death and survive even the most unlikely situations. When you do this, choose one of the following two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Die Another Day</strong>: Instead of dying, your character is knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise taken out of action; your character will survive, no matter the fatal incident's circumstances, but takes no further part in the current encounter.</li>\n<li><strong>How Did That Miss?</strong>: Your character completely avoids the incoming damage by some extraordinary fluke, such as slipping just as a blow is about to connect, a weapon mysteriously jamming, or an unexpected source of light blinding an opponent; your character can continue on without penalty, but has no guarantee of survival in later rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first option takes you out of play, but allows you to fight another day, for all your character may be battered, bloody, bruised, and perhaps even captured in the process! The second option allows you to continue fighting side-by-side with your companions, but leaves you in significant danger, meaning you may need to spend more Fate points in later Rounds to ensure survival. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, depending upon the context of the situation, and it is up to you to decide which is the best choice to take.</p>\n<p>The GM describes how you survive a given situation after spending a Fate rating point. </p>\n<h4>Regaining Fate and Fortune</h4>\n<p>You regain all Fortune points at the start of every gaming session, up to the maximum of your current Fate. In addition, certain in-game encounters may also replenish (or remove!) Fortune points. </p>\n<p>Your GM may grant you a Fate point for an act of extreme heroism, bravery, or significance. Normally this only happens at the successful end of an important adventure, so make sure to spend them carefully as they rarely replenish.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Resilience and Resolve</h3>\n<p>While Fate points represent your destiny, perhaps chosen by some distant, uncaring deity, Resilience is an indication of your personal drive and determination to endure, and overcome, no matter the obstacles you face.</p>\n<p>Like Fate, Resilience is directly linked to a pool of points, this time called Resolve. Resolve points are spent to push through minor obstacles, such as ignoring the negative effects of critical wounds for a Round or removing Conditions. Resilience determines your upper limit of Resolve points and can be permanently spent to push yourself through seemingly impossible situations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Resolve</h4>\n<p>You may spend a Resolve point to draw upon your inner reserves: maybe confronting a terrifying Ogre without flinching; or ignoring the effects of even the most powerful of blows. Your choices are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become immune to Psychology until the end of the next Round.</li>\n<li>Ignore all modifiers from all Critical Wounds until the beginning of the next Round</li>\n<li>Remove one Condition; if you removed the @Condition[Prone] Condition, regain 1 Wound as you surge to your feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Resilience</h4>\n<p>You may also choose to spend Resilience point to defy the corruption curling  within, or to succeed where it would seem certain you should fail. Here, you have the following two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I Deny You!</strong>: You may choose not to develop a rolled mutation. Because you do not mutate, you do not lose any Corruption Points.</li>\n<li><strong>I Will Not Fail!</strong>: Rather than roll the result of a Test, you can choose the number instead, allowing you to succeed in even the direst situations. In an Opposed Test, you always win by at least 1 SL. You can even choose to do this on a Test already failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving permanent Resilience to rebuff the influence of Chaos is wise, but it does not remove your Corruption points, meaning mutation is still perilously close. By comparison, using permanent Resilience to succeed in any Test can allow you to land a blow on an otherwise impossible-to-hit target, create an artefact that astounds all who see it with a Trade skill, or even perfectly manifest a spell you would normally find impossible to cast.</p>\n<p>When you spend a Resilience point, take time to describe the enormous feat of will your character has undertaken, and how this manifests in play.</p>\n<h4>Regaining Resilience and Resolve</h4>\n<p>Resolve is regained whenever you act according to your Motivation. During play, whenever you feel you have done this, you may ask the GM if you can recover one or more Resolve points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Griselda is a nun with the Motivation ‘Sigmar’. While her allies gossip in a tavern seeking clues, she elects to visit the local temple to make a donation and offer prayers to her deity. As this fits her Motivation, her GM decides to replenish one of her Resolve points but tells Griselda’s player that she will need to pray and donate in a different temple to receive that benefit again this week. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GM may grant a Resilience point for an act of extreme importance to your Motivation, permanently nourishing your soul, but such an event will be very rare.</p>\n<p>Example: After many adventures, Griselda finally finances a new temple to Sigmar in her home village of Velten not far from Nuln. The GM recognises the importance of this to Griselda’s faith and grants her a permanent Resilience point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: A bandit leader is on the rampage, having built up 10 Advantage while evading the party’s blows. Things are about to get messy! Salundra decides to attack the bandit, but loses the Opposed Test by 7 SL, which is going to hurt a lot. So, she spends a permanent Resilience point to invoke ‘I Will Not Fail’. This means she automatically wins the Opposed Test by +1 SL. She also chooses the result of the roll to be 11, causing a Critical. The bandit leader will take some Wounds and a Critical Wound. More importantly, his rampage comes to an end as he also loses all 10 Advantage as the fight turns in the heroes favour. </p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":400001}}}
{"_id":"03r3y37RFKAFM82c","name":"Pursuit","content":"<p>Desperate chase scenes through busy markets and high-speed pursuits hanging from the back of careening coaches are the centrepiece of many exciting adventures. Here’s how to run a pursuit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Distance </strong>— The GM decides how far ahead the pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong> — Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test for their movement — typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances. </li>\n<li><strong>Update Distance</strong> — The lowest SL of the pursued and the highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted from the Distance number if the pursuers won.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Outcome</strong> — If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it’s quite likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and the pursuit is over… for now! If the Distance is still 1–9, the pursuit continues, return to step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As each Round passes, it’s important to describe what just happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity to make ground. If you score a negative SL, describe tripping over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against a wall, slowing you down.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Eichengard and Sigrid are chasing three cultists through the streets of Altdorf. The cultists got a decent head start, so the GM gives him a lead of Distance 2. Each character rolls an Athletics Test to start the pursuit. Sigrid scores +3 SL;  the cultists score +0, +2, and +2 SL; and Eichengard scores +2 SL. </em></p>\n<p><em>So, after the first round, the difference between the slowest cultist (0) and the fastest pursuing character (Sigrid with 3) is 3, meaning that the characters catch up with the cultists. The cowardly cultists abandon their slowest member in the hope of saving their hides, and Sigrid stops to subdue the abandoned aberrant. </em></p>\n<p><em>Next round the cultists start at a Distance of 1 (the difference between the next slowest cultist and Sigrid last round) so Eichengard just needs to beat them by +1 SL to catch up again.</em></p>\n<h4>Movement Modifiers</h4>\n<p>If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Perdita is urging her horse forwards, trying to chase down two Bandits. Her horse has Movement 8, where the Bandits are on Movement 7 and Movement 9 horses. Thus, the first Bandit has an unmodified Test, Perdita gains a bonus of +1 SL, and the second Bandit gains a bonus of +2 SL when they all roll their Ride (Horse) Tests.</em></p>","folder":"BwGBqjkeBJcgiZyn","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Moving"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Moving","sort":300001}}}

Whenever you are instructed to damage a piece of armour, the APs in the location damaged are reduced by 1. </p>\n<p>If this lowers the APs to 0 in that location, the armour there is rendered useless.</p>\n<p>Armour is generally damaged in one of two ways: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>A special ability triggers, such as a spell or Talent, damaging a piece of armour</li>\n<li>A Critical Wound is deflected</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Critical Deflection</h4>\n<p>This only occurs should you choose it to. If you suffer a Critical Wound from an incoming attack on a location protected by armour, you can choose to let your armour be damaged by 1AP in order to ignore the Critical Wound. </p>\n<p>You still suffer all normal Wounds (and given your APs are now 1 point lower, you probably suffer an extra Wound), but you avoid the Critical Wound effects as the blow is absorbed by your now-damaged armour.</p>\n<h4>Repairing Armour</h4>\n<p>It costs 10% of the armour’s base price per AP lost to repair it. So, if you had a Sleeved Chainmail Coat with 1AP of damage on the Body, and 1AP of damage on the Arms, it will cost you 20% of your armour’s base cost to fix it, in this case 12/–. If a section of your armour is completely broken, it will cost you 30% of the armour’s base cost to fix, and you’ll likely be waiting some time before it’s completed. </p>\n<p>You can also repair your own armour if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, Trade Tools and, for Plate Armour, a Workshop.</p>\n<h3>Armour Qualities</h3>\n<p>Armour can possess the following Armour Qualities:</p>\n<h4>Flexible</h4>\n<p>Flexible armour can be worn under a layer of non-Flexible armour if you wish. If you do so, you gain the benefit of both.</p>\n<h4>Impenetrable</h4>\n<p>The armour is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply cannot penetrate it. All Critical Wounds caused by an odd number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored.</p>\n<h3>Armour Flaws</h3>\n<p>Some armours have points of weakness, as described by Armour Flaws.</p>\n<h4>Partial</h4>\n<p>The armour does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores the partial armour’s APs.</p>\n<h4>Weakpoints</h4>\n<p>The armour has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky.

{"_id":"1BTOtQ5fabJYODnr","name":"Reikland Council","content":"<p>The day-to-day business of ruling the province is handled by the Reikland Council, which comprises ten ‘High Lords’. The council meets weekly in the Wilhelm Chamber of the Volkshalle in Altdorf to discuss matters of import. It is rare for more than six of the high lords to attend simultaneously, and almost unheard of for the prince to attend in person.</p>\n<h4>The High Lords of the Reikland</h4>\n<p>The Ten High Lords of the Council of the Reikland, are appointed by the grand prince. Whilst most commoners could never hope to encounter such luminaries, their agents and representatives can be found everywhere.</p>\n<h4>High Lord of the Chair</h4>\n<p>A close advisor to the grand prince, the High Lord of the Chair officially leads the Reikland Council in the elector count’s stead.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord of the Chair, the stoic Graf Archibold von Lilahalle, was granted the influential position after being gravely wounded whilst saving the life of Emperor Luitpold III from an assassin’s blade. Lingering, painful injuries confine him to a steam-driven wheelchair; an irony only the unwise note aloud.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Steward</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Steward is the only man legally allowed to judge a crime committed by the lord of a Reikland Estate. As a High Lord Stewart’s Court is rarely called — most lords being simply too powerful to call to task — the position is largely ceremonial. Nevertheless, the High Lord Steward is arguably the most senior High Lord, and often stands in for the Grand Prince when he is unable — or unwilling — to attend court.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Steward is Archduke Adelbert von Bögenberg, a quiet man with little experience of the law, but a shrewd understanding of people. As much of the grand prince’s time is taken up with imperial matters, he is arguably the  de facto  ruler of the Reikland, much to the High Lord of the Chair’s chagrin.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Treasurer</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Treasurer is responsible for the Reikland’s treasury and for raising revenues. The position is extraordinarily important and is almost always held by a close ally of the crown.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Treasurer is the aging genius Grafina Elena von Midwald, a dear friend of the previous grand prince, well known for her outspoken appreciation of fine wine and fine men.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Ambassador</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Ambassador organises the Reikland’s foreign relations and runs the Altdorf Black Chamber: the infamous spies of the Reikland.</p>\n<p>Graf Liepmund Holzkrug, the current High Lord Ambassador, is an intense, fiercely ambitious man, whose family are strong rivals to House Holswig-Schliestein in Altdorf. He is known for his vindictive nature, his ruthless politics, and his love of hunting rare and exotic game.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Judge</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Judge is the ultimate voice on all Reiklander Law, which is quite different from Imperial Law.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Judge of the Reikland also serves as Supreme Law Lord of the Empire: Lector Agatha von Böhrn of Verena. She is experienced in all legal matters, and widely regarded as one of the most intelligent people in the Empire, especially by those who have bribed her.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Chancellor</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Chancellor is the crown’s spiritual advisor, and oversees the Reikland Chancery and the Silver Seal. </p>\n<p>The current High Lord Chancellor is High Priestess Halma Habermann of Sigmar, a robust woman with a pale complexion, rosy cheeks, and thick limbs. Though generally charming and approachable, she is zealously out-spoken in her opposition to the Colleges of Magic, and rumours abound regarding the atrocities she witnessed during her service in the Order of the Silver Hammer.  </p>\n<h4>High Lord Chamberlain</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Chamberlain runs the Palace of Altdorf and the adjoining Volkshall. The position is arguably one of the most influential in the Reikland, as most high-level imperial politics take place within the chamberlain’s domain.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Chamberlain is rake-thin Duchess Elze von Skaag, an astute negotiator and careful planner who publicly supports Emperor Karl-Franz in all matters. Elze’s husband, Duke Alardus von Skaag, is said to be deeply frustrated at his wife residing in Altdorf and not in Skaggerdorf with him; by comparison, it seems to suit her perfectly as most evenings she can be found carousing through the city with her bodyguards.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Reiksmarshal</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Reiksmarshal is responsible for leading the armies of the Reikland, and ensuring each of the Reikland State Regiments is raised, financed, and made available to the crown as required.</p>\n<p>The current Reiksmarshal is the veteran general Duke Kurt Helborg, close friend and tutor to the current grand prince — Emperor Karl-Franz — and said to be the finest swordsman in the Empire. Helborg’s military commitments ensure that he rarely takes his seat on the council, a circumstance that suits his natural inclination.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Constable</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Constable is the ultimate authority on the genealogy and heraldry of the Reikland.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Constable is smiling Grafina Matrella von Achern, a woman with no interest in genealogy, but a voracious appetite for political intrigue. She has made the most of this relatively inconsequential position, by chairing several private councils on the Grand Prince’s behalf. It is hard to reconcile the bubbly, maternal demeanour she projects, and her reputation amongst her peers as the most ruthless woman in the Reikland.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Admiral</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Admiral is responsible for the Admiralty of the Reik, and thus the entire Reikland navy.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Admiral is the venerable Sea Lord Adalmann von Hopfberg. The Sea Lord — who is now quite senile — took residency in the Great Hospice some fifteen years ago, and the Admiralty has governed the navy without his influence — or interference — since then.</p>","folder":"uBBxv0cG8Y9UY2M9","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Politics"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Politics","sort":200001}}}

Many theologians tie Rhya to the Old Faith, a prehistoric cult comprised of ancient farmers and hunters who wrested a living from the land before the Empire was born, and one still found in secluded communities to this day.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Rural folk across the Old World venerate Rhya, relying on her to provide the crops upon which their lives depends. Womanfolk comprise the main body of the cult, and most midwives pay at least lip-service to Rhya’s Wisdom, a set of oral traditions surrounding childbirth. Although she is not openly worshipped in the towns and cities — townsfolk often turning to Shallya in her stead — her name is frequently tied with Taal’s, so she is still well known amongst such people. </p>\n<p>Because the cult has no great temples and protects no holy books or relics of significance, many scholars believe her worship to be declining, and possibly already dead. Her many cultists do nothing to contradict such talk.</p>\n<p>Rhya’s cultists have no fixed vestment or preferred garb, though greens are very common, as is using plants, flowers, or herbs to accessorise any clothing. They often dress in a fashion considered far too revealing by Sigmarite doctrine, which can cause friction as the Rhyans believe giving in to such prudishness is tantamount to encouraging the Prince of Excess into your lives, as it builds forbidden desires. Devotees of Sigmar invariably disagree, believing abstinence and restricting temptation is a better response to such dangers than indulgence.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Rhya has no large temples, though many ancient sites constructed from oghams (standing stones) are centres of worship for her cult, and some still echo each equinox with the cries of fevered celebrants.</p>\n<p>Shrines to Rhya are usually simple statues of the goddess, often piled high with offerings of food and drink. Older shrines are often made of small standing stones marked with worn, spiralled patterns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Rhyan penances may involve replanting devastated areas, helping broken households, and maintaining sacred groves. It is also common to find Rhyans tasked to protect helpless families, which can often put them at odds with local bailiffs and law enforcement. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Defend families, children, and crops from all harm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never feel shame for the flesh Rhya gave you.</em></li>\n<li><em>Life is sacred, do no harm lest another life is in danger.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never judge whom another loves.</em></li>\n<li><em>Interrupt the work of the Prince of Excess wherever it may thirst</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.maUl7MoLvuvTOhM0]{Blessing of Grace}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.C92dpJPRYpkZFsGu]{Blessing of Healing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Jkt465WPdRcejLwl]{Blessing of Recuperation}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.qB1T6ii29jreZBRP]{Rhya's Children}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.OiMiQmsv1mut24jD]{Rhya's Harvest}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.25trttu8NxFQQCo9]{Rhya's Shelter}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.pBWXlJDOE7tfl8hP]{Rhya's Succour}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0uT3mzx8v4H3gVQj]{Rhya's Touch}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.dDxhGgBBM9CugxsH]{Rhya's Union}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/rhya.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":700001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":700001}}}

A relatively placid river with a clear, smooth, but not overly swift ﬂow, the Bögen readily allows traffic to sail upriver nearly as easily as down. Its great depth allows larger river going vessels to navigate safely from @JournalEntry[The Reik] all the way to Bögenhafen. Though its source lies deep in the freezing peaks of @JournalEntry[o2mz58EtayxnAJNY]{The Grey Mountains}, the Bögen turns warm as it ﬂows through the hilly Vorbergland, which frequently causes heavy mists to gather along its banks. Most evenings, fingers of roiling fog rise from the Bögen, wrapping tendrils about nearby settlements and the surrounding @JournalEntry[MGRKx5DJV6bHxSku]{Reikwald}.

{"_id":"2jOnMEHS9Xt26AQ7","name":"Dwarfs","content":"<p>Dwarfs — or ‘Dawi’ as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff and stubborn. While the majority reside in vast mountainside fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain.</p>\n<p>Dwarf culture respects skill in crafting — chiefly stonework, smithing and engineering — and Dwarf Holds are resplendent with impressive feats of artifice. They also covet gold and jewels, mining deep beneath the mountains in the pursuit of precious metals and gemstones. However, more than these material possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have entire religions focussing upon important progenitors. Dwarfs cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with intricate runes to harness magical power. </p>\n<p>However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are mistaken for magic by simpler folk. </p>\n<p>Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a  fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf ’s friendship, once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down in battle, such is the strength of their conviction.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans…</h4>\n<p><em>‘Like my father and my father afore me, I’ve been living in Reikland all me life.

You may undertake a maximum of one Endeavour per week you are not adventuring, and you may attempt a maximum of three Endeavours in total, regardless of how long the gap between adventures may be. The rest of your time, whether it be weeks, months, or years, is taken up with living your life in relative peace — whatever that may to look like to your character. </p>\n<p>While most of these Endeavours can be attempted by anyone, some are better suited to a particular Class or Career.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Year In, Year Out</p>\n<p>If the period between adventures is particularly long, you can discuss with the GM how to lengthen the narrative scope of your Endeavours. For instance, if you want to commission a new sword with the Commission Endeavour, you may first have to find a skilled smith, then the correct materials, then wait for other commissions to be completed, then maybe your sword is stolen, and so it goes on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Money To Burn</strong></h3>\n<p>After you’ve rolled on the @Table[event], you can spend the money earned during your last adventures using the normal rules. Then, after completing your Endeavours, all money held by your character is considered spent. All of it. The silver lifted from a Burgher’s purse? Gone. The booty liberated from pirates? Also gone. That Troll hoard you raided? Gone, too. All of it.</p>\n<p>What happened to it? It was spent, stolen, drunk, gambled, used for repairs, to pay off debts or taxes, given as a charitable donations or votive offerings, spent on bribes, or used in whatever other way you prefer. You should concoct the best story for what happens to those funds, as it explains a lot about your character.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep some of your hard-won coin to use in the future, you should undertake the @JournalEntry[If8o9wgSOggLiHCV]{Banking} Endeavour. If you want money at the beginning of the next adventure —honestly, or otherwise, depending on your Career — you should undertake the @JournalEntry[lRWvy2uSVgq4RADa]{Income} Endeavour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Duties &amp; Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>You may lose one or more of your Endeavours due to your Career or Species. </p>\n<h4><strong>With Great Power…</strong></h4>\n<p><em>‘The common folk will never understand my burdens.

The guilty will not judge themselves and there are always so many villages to cleanse, for our enemies are legion.’ </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Lothar Metzger, Witch Hunter</em></p>\n<p>As you climb the ranks of your career, you accrue expectations and responsibilities that cannot be avoided. Noble Lords must see to the affairs of their estates, Guildmasters must oversee their guild’s work, and Watch Captains must watch their watchmen. If you neglect your responsibilities, you will soon lose status amongst your peers.</p>\n<p>If you have attained one of the top two tiers of your Career Path and do not undertake the Income Endeavour, which reflects taking care of your obligations, you drop one level within your Career; reverting from the fourth level to the third, or the third to the second. This costs no Experience Points, acting as a free Career change, albeit downwards.</p>\n<p>With this step backwards in your Career Path, you will now have a lower Status, and will earn less money should you perform future @JournalEntry[lRWvy2uSVgq4RADa]{Income} Endeavours.

It is not the stench — though that is abhorrent — it is not the noise, either — it is just that you are all so very ugly to look upon, I feel that I must gaze at something beautiful for a time or I know that I shall start screaming, and never stop.’</em> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Irlianmaris Ellarel, Asur Envoy</em></p>\n<p>Elves, even those resident within the borders of Empire, do not consider themselves citizens of the Empire. There are High Elves with diplomatic positions in Karl-Franz I’s court, as well as traders and merchant princes in many of the great cities of the Empire, but the majority of the Asur avoid entanglements with Humans (not to mention Dwarfs) and few would call a Reiklander ‘friend’. </p>\n<p>The Wood Elves are even more removed; nearly mythical, rarely seen, and when they do appear they always have their own concerns that they rarely share with others.</p>\n<p>Between adventures, all Elven characters must undertake one Endeavour maintaining contact with their own kind, seeing to their responsibilities to their people. High Elves commonly give reports on interesting things they’ve learned to agents of Ulthuan in either Altdorf or Marienburg, whereas Asrai do the same with the spies from their arboreal homes. This Endeavour offers no advantage beyond the inherent advantage of being an Elf.

If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Combining Difficulties</em></h3>\n<p><em>There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. Lurking in a gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent on a bright day in an open field. When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests <strong>Hard (–20)</strong>. When combined, the Test would simply be <strong>Very Hard (–30),</strong> rather than suffer a –40 modifier. Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an <strong>Easy (+20)</strong> Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be <strong>Difficult (–10) </strong>since –30 plus +20 equals –10.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Options: Shooting Into Melee</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is enough of a complication. However, some prefer the rules be more precise when firing at an Engaged target. If this is you, use the following rules:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Ballistic Skill Tests against Engaged opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a penalty of –20 as you try your best to hit your specified target. If this modifier causes you to fail when the Test would otherwise have succeeded, you instead hit one of the target’s Engaged opponents, as determined randomly by the gM. If you do not care whom you hit, you may gain a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see Shooting into a Group.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":300001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Combat","sort":300001}}}
{"_id":"4WEhiObwXJKErVFi","name":"Altdorf","content":"<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Emperor Karl-Franz I holds court in Altdorf, the capital of the Reikland and the Empire as a whole. It stands proudly at the conﬂuence of the mighty @JournalEntry[The Reik]{Reik} and Talabec rivers, as well as at the end of many major trade routes, and is easily the wealthiest city in the Empire. This ensures it is always expanding and renewing, with fresh, wide-eyed hopefuls arriving daily, and more commissions for new bridges, buildings, and engineering marvels presented weekly to the city’s burgomeisters than most cities consider in a year.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Today, Altdorf is a city of steam-powered bridges, mismatched islands, enormous tenements, and seemingly endless hordes of people: one cannot traverse its crooked streets without becoming intimately familiar with complete strangers. Because it draws merchants and diplomats from across the Known World, it is also surprisingly cosmopolitan; not only do folk of all ranks, races, creeds, and backgrounds rub shoulders freely, but even wizards are a common sight, rarely receiving more hostility than a wary glance or muttered blessing. </span> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Always surprising outsiders, a populous Elf quarter thrives near the Reiksport — Altdorf ’s deep-water harbour and shipyard — founded by High Elf merchant princes trading up the Reik from Marienburg over a century ago. The old alliance between the Empire and Dwarfs has stood since Sigmar’s time and ensures many Dwarf clans also reside there in tight-knit communities, some having toiled on the city’s stonework for untold generations, though naturally their stubborn natures preclude them from ever calling Altdorf home. There is even a healthy Halﬂing population, with most earning their crusts serving fine food and better ales in Altdorf ’s hostelries, many of which are guarded by the city’s sizeable Ogre population. Even odder creatures also call the city home, with none more fantastic than those found in the Imperial Zoo, which boasts myriad monsters and animals including the Abomination of Stirland and the Drakwald Gibberbeast, each caged and displayed for the amusement of all.</span> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This enormous and varied population helps secure one of Altdorf’s more notorious traits: it is infamously smelly, known aﬀectionately, and all too accurately, as ‘The Great Reek’. During the hot, summer months the stench rolling in from the @JournalEntry[fZKynnyBSGStMXEQ]{Altdorf Flats} grows so potent that many of the city’s wealthiest citizens ﬂee to country estates or the sumptuous, sun-kissed palaces of Grenstadt in Southern Averland.</span> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The ever-present fetor does little to ease Altdorf’s citizenry, a mob known for being uniquely vocal and prone to rioting at any imagined slight, especially if it involves new taxes. Even seemingly trivial actions of the local burgomeisters and nobles can earn their ire; but the fact that many of their protests are entirely fair does not lessen the crown’s fervor in quashing any rebellious rabbles that may take to the streets.</span> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Altdorf is also a renowned centre for learning. The sons and daughters of wealthy households matriculate at the University of Altdorf, often with little regard to academic ability; those with scholarly potential, but without the financial clout to match it, often find their way to the High Temple of Verena, for the Goddess of Wisdom always has space for those blessed with intellect. The famed Imperial Engineers’ School — founded by Tilean genius Leonardo da Miragliano — also lies within Altdorf ’s walls. Here some of the Empire’s bravest, and most reckless, souls devise new and inventive methods for raining fiery death on the enemies of mankind. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the school has been rebuilt over a dozen times since it was founded. </span> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Arguably the most significant educational institution in Altdorf is also its most mysterious: The Colleges of Magic. Founded over two centuries ago at the behest of Emperor Magnus the Pious, the colleges are guided by the principles and precepts of the elven Loremaster Teclis. The colleges are charged with training magically gifted citizens to channel their dangerous talents in the defence of the Empire. Rumours of the warping inﬂuence of the potent magical energies gathered by so many wizards living in such close proximity persist; allegedly the very streets of the capital have been twisted, and certain college buildings are believed to be hidden from all but those few blessed — or should that be cursed — with witchsight, but few believe such talk. </span> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Standing in stark contrast to the arcane mysteries of the Colleges of Magic, and as a bulwark against any errant witches or rogue magisters, Altdorf is also the beating heart of the Cult of Sigmar. Over two-thousand five-hundred years ago, Sigmar was born, raised, and eventually crowned as first emperor within the boundaries of modern Altdorf, and fttingly the city now boasts more Sigmarite temples and holy sites than all the other cities of the Empire combined. Indeed, it is often said that one cannot throw a heretic without hitting a temple of Sigmar in the city.</span> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Let Nothing Be Wasted</strong>: Willibert Klemm — a merchant from <strong>Altdorf </strong>— is livid at the loss in profits from the incursion of Giant Spiders into the @JournalEntry[63GgEPH3biraoOBx]{Bloodpine Woods}.

This has led to rough times on Altdorf ’s streets as the Watch and State Army cracks down hard on any they believe may be revolutionaries — but such conflict breeds opportunity. Some are quick to take the Emperor’s Shilling and put the boot to revolutionaries, whilst others are quick to take up the banner of freedom (and whatever coinage they can scrape together). But when a recently enrolled group discovers the Cult of Verena is quietly supporting the Glorious Revolution, and that the Law Lord of the Empire herself is apparently financing the Tail , what should be done with such information?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","img":null,"folder":"GI7xBjKQuHF94BnM","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Settlements"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Settlements","sort":100001}}}

So, setting down his tankard, he turns around to ‘have a word’ with the offending Elf, unable to stop himself from launching into a tirade about exactly what he thinks of their so-called nimbleness!</p>\n<h3>Psychology Traits</h3>\n<p>The following are the most common Psychology traits in WFRP.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Q2MCUrG2HppMcvN0]{Animosity (Target)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear (Rating)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.DrNUTPeodEgpWTnT]{Frenzy}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.5hH73j2NgPdsLCZN]{Hatred (Target)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.klCJX0mNpXYH5AIx]{Prejudice}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.meMkLEwdJIDLxM0B]{Terror (Rating)}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Custom Psychology</h3>\n<p>You can create your own psychological traits to reflect the events of your game. This is something that will vary depending on your group, and the style of game you choose to play. It is also an area that should be treated sensitively, and if in any doubt avoid anything that could upset a member of the group.</p>\n<p>In addition to the mechanical effects of these custom traits, they are a wonderful opportunity for roleplaying; taking on custom psychological traits allows you to show off or practice your roleplaying skills, and maybe earn some extra XP. See Advances in Chapter 2: Character for more about this.</p>\n<p>When making custom traits, you should consider both what provokes the trait to manifest, and what the effect will be. Will it make the character immune to some, or all other psychology traits? Will it offer a bonus in some situations? A penalty in others? As always, your GM is the ultimate arbiter in this situation. Sample bonuses or penalties a Psychological trait may offer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+1/–1 SL to specified Tests</li>\n<li>Immunity to specified psychological traits</li>\n<li>Prescribed or Proscribed Actions and Moves</li>\n<li>Gaining Conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.EBmSCscpk4vEDCD3]{Camaraderie (Group)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Mu5dU4IcP58LBQwi]{Phobia (Target)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.1y6Hv22y9C3UD8gX]{Trauma}</p>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":800001}}}

Known for his black moods and erratic temper, folk claim his cult is needed more than any other, for if ever there is a god that must be appeased, it’s Manaan. He’s depicted as an enormous, black-bearded man with seaweed in his hair and a great, five-pointed crown of black iron upon his troubled brow. He’s said to dwell at the bottom of the ocean, the rise and fall of his massive chest forming the waves and tides as the greatest monsters of the deep gather in his court.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Manann is worshipped along coasts throughout the Old World, wherever people make their living from the sea or live close enough for storms and floods to threaten their homes. Even those who know little of Manann will throw a coin or other small treasure into the water before beginning a sea voyage in the hope of a smooth crossing.</p>\n<p>The cult has a significant number of orders, mostly monastic, tasked to guard isolated, sacred islands. The Order of the Albatross is largest, comprised of priests who maintain temples across the Old World and bless merchant or naval vessels with their presence. Often accompanying them, the Order of the Mariner is the military arm of Manann, the cult’s templar-marines, sworn protectors of Marienburg.</p>\n<p>Manann’s clerics usually wear robes of dark greenish-blue or blue-grey, trimmed with a white wave-pattern.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Manann’s temples are found in all coastal towns and cities, and in most river ports where seagoing vessels berth. The high temple is in the great port-city of Marienburg: a huge, lavishly decorated complex open to the tides. The Matriarch of the Sea, head of the Order of the Albatross, is based there, a woman who ostensibly leads the entire cult of Manann, although in practice the sea-god’s clerics are as mercurial as  their god, and as likely to be stubborn as to serve.  The cult also maintains many monasteries and abbeys on small isolated islands, most dedicated to one of Manann’s many saints. </p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances from Manann often involve hazardous, maritime pilgrimages, tests of sailing skills, or expeditions against the sea-god’s enemies, especially followers of the heretical cult of Stromfels, God of Pirates, Wreckers, and Sharks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"font-style:normal\"><strong>Strictures</strong></h3>\n<ul style=\"font-style:normal\">\n<li>No whistling or swearing when at sea or on holy ground.</li>\n<li>Never harm an albatross.</li>\n<li>First catch to Manann.</li>\n<li>A silver and fish to every Manannite temple and shrine approached.</li>\n<li>Hunt down the servants of Stromfels wherever they may hide.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Geo6EAR39JzaP9P2]{Becalm}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.i5DW3xX2lGu6Pps6]{Drowned Man's Face}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.nQ9Fydtqshroi11E]{Fair Winds}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.IKW03JiqXVdDoPA6]{Manann's Bounty}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.VUyCJ5LRPkuC5iZx]{Sea Legs}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iWVQRVDVDCx1SyPA]{Waterwalk}</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/manann.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":300001}}}
{"_id":"5UVBumUG1gBLetDB","name":"The Cult of Shallya, Goddess of Mercy","content":"<p><strong>Seat of Power</strong>: Couronne, Bretonnia</p>\n<p><strong>Head of the Cult</strong>: Grande Matriarch</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Orders</strong>: Order of the Bleeding Heart, Order of the Chalice</p>\n<p><strong>Major Festivals</strong>: None</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Holy Books</strong>: <em>The Book of Suffering, Livre des Larmes, The Testament of Pergunda</em></p>\n<p><strong>Common Holy Symbols</strong>: White doves, keys, heart with a drop of blood</p>\n<p>Shallya is the Goddess of Healing, Mercy, and Compassion. She is the daughter of Verena and Morr, and the sister of Myrmidia. Shallya is normally portrayed as a young, beautiful maiden whose eyes are perpetually welling with tears as she weeps for the world’s pain. It is said Shallya’s compassion knows no bounds, and in some myths — such as the stories of Ranald tricking her into granting him immortality, or Manaan trapping her at the bottom of the sea — she seems trusting to the point of foolishness. However, her cultists maintain her mercy is available to all, without judgment. True foolishness consists of presuming to judge who is worthy of Shallya’s grace and who is not.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Most Old Worlders think of Shallya’s cult as composed of healers and physicians, but her worshippers also include many who work to help alleviate suffering of other kinds: charitable souls who help the poor; workers in orphanages, asylums, and refuges; and even brave folk who go in search of lost and missing people on behalf of their loved ones.  The cult is ruled by the far-reaching Order of the Bleeding Heart, which maintains all the temples, hospices, mercyhouses, and other holy sites. The significantly smaller Order of the Chalice tasks its mendicants to cleanse the Fly Lord’s influence, tackling the worst diseases and plagues wherever they may fester.</p>\n<p>Shallya’s cultists all wear white robes, often hooded, with a bleeding heart symbol embroidered on the left breast.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>The high temple of all Shallya’s cult is in Couronne, Bretonnia, built over a famous healing spring. Locals claim the magical waters were once poured there from the same chalice Shallya used to grant Ranald immortality, which they claim is the holy grail of the Lady, the patron Goddess of Bretonnia. Whatever the truth, it is a popular destination for pilgrims, many of whom travel there to be healed from intractable disease. Elsewhere, every town or city of any size has a temple to Shallya, and most smaller settlements have at least a shrine dedicated to her. Temples of Shallya normally consist of a courtyard with a temple on one side and an infirmary on the other, all constructed in southern styles. Larger temples have smaller subsidiary chapels, commonly endowed by local families, and are often connected to hospitals. Shrines are usually simple, often with the dove or heart of Shallya carved into stone, or with small fountains gushing eternal tears from simple statues.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Shallya always involve helping the sick, poor, or downtrodden. A cultist might be sent to a village struck by a plague to tend the sick until the disease has passed. Shallya often tasks her servants to help the wounded at war, or patrol popular pilgrimage routes for those unable to complete their journeys due to ill health.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Strictures</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Always render assistance without judgement, based only on a person’s need.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never kill except in self-defence or when facing followers of the Fly Lord.</em></li>\n<li><em>Hunt down servants of the Fly Lord wherever they may fester.</em></li>\n<li><em>Shallya’s work is never done, so turn not to self-indulgence.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never take up arms; a walking stick and courage will suffice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.C92dpJPRYpkZFsGu]{Blessing of Healing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Jkt465WPdRcejLwl]{Blessing of Recuperation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.uMECZBuDnb3qkc7k]{Anchorite's Endurance}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.8LcAFB6W37LDN70K]{Balm to a Wounded Mind}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.UtgGJK46K08TZpP5]{Bitter Catharsis}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.YCjWyU567vb4Rs11]{Martyr}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.YAauxOwJJa3JahxQ]{Shallya's Tears}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SItGUVYokyOo7csk]{Unblemished Innocence}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/shallya.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":800001}}}

After all, if you repeatedly appear as poorer than you are, others will unsurprisingly think you’re poor. In practice, dressing and eating as expected, and using trappings that are fitting for your station, is enough for most folks to simply accept you at face value. What this requires in practice is left up to the GM to determine, using the following as a guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brass Tier</strong>: The poorest members of society are unlikely to see a gold coin in their lifetimes. They live humble lives, subsisting on plain foods and sleeping in shared rooms, and have little appearances to maintain. Indeed, peers are more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are likely to note spending too little.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Silver Tier</strong>: The swelling middle-classes may use pennies for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their standard currency. They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds, and wear good quality clothing.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Gold Tier</strong>: The wealthiest elites rarely bother themselves with pfennigs. They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets, and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive garb and trappings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For GMs preferring hard numbers, spending around half your Status every day is usually enough to maintain appearances, though you may be living a little frugally.

Recently, bloodpine has become hard to source, for the Bloodpine Woods are plagued by Forest Goblins of the Spiderclaw tribe who’ve managed to tame a handful of swift-moving Giant Spiders. Few dare to work there now, for those attempting to cut the trees simply disappear, their cries echoing from the mists high in the trees before suddenly falling silent. This has, of course, only served to increase the value of bloodpine, which has deeply enraged purchasers, several of whom have taken to hiring mercenaries and private parties to clear the Goblins, figuring it is cheaper to throw bodies at the problem than pay more for their new fling cabinet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What's In A Name?</strong>: In the <strong>the Bloodpine Woods</strong>, not far from <strong>Ambergrissen</strong>, a ring of corpses hangs upside down lashed to trees.

If you succeed, you have located your expert.

But try playing without that 10%, and you’ll lose every time.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Hermann Graumann, Gambler, Raconteur and Liar</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">During the game, you’ll find yourself in all sorts of situations where the outcome your Character’s action is uncertain. Will you jump the ravine or plunge to your death? Will you charm the officious courtier, or will the guards be summoned to deal with you? How well you perform these actions is determined by your Skills and Talents. In general, Skills describe the capabilities of your Character, and Talents are special abilities or tricks you’ve learned.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Skills</h2>\n<p>Where Characteristics represent the raw potential of your body and mind, Skills represent specific areas of training, knowledge, experience. Each Advance you take in a Skill improves the odds of succeeding with appropriate tasks — Characters who are well trained or experienced may be able to best opponents who are more naturally gifted.</p>\n<h3>Determining your Skill Level</h3>\n<p>All Skills are associated with a single Characteristic, noted in the Skill’s description. A Skill’s rating is determined by taking its associated Characteristic and adding the number of Advances taken in the Skill. Space for recording your Advances for each Skill is provided on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has a Fellowship of 41 and has taken 5 Advances in Charm, so her Charm is 46 (41+5=46).</em></p>\n<h3>Basic and Advanced Skills</h3>\n<p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>.</p>\n<p>Basic Skills represent innate or common abilities that you might practice in day-to-day life. Basic Skills can be Tested even if you have taken no Advances in them. To do this, simply attempt a Test using the Characteristic associated with the Skill as described in Chapter 5: Rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has no Advances in Athletics. However, as Athletics is a Basic Skill, she can still Test Athletics using the Characteristic associated with it: Agility.</em></p>\n<p>Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, training, or first-hand experience to even attempt to use. You may only Test an Advanced Skill if you have taken at least one Advance in it. If you have not, you cannot attempt to Test the Skill. So, no matter how intelligent you are, you will not understand the finer points of law without the Lore (Law) Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Adhemar has an Intelligence of 36 and no Advances in either the Basic Gamble Skill or the Advanced Heal Skill, both based on Intelligence. He can Test the Gamble Skill at 36% as it is Basic, and anyone can Test Basic Skills. The Heal Skill is an Advanced Skill, so Adhemar has no idea how to patch up wounds beyond screaming loudly for a doctor!</em></p>\n<h3>Grouped Skills and Specialisation</h3>\n<p>Some Skills are classified as Grouped . This means the Skill is an array of related Skills under one heading. Each related Skill is called a Specialisation . When a Specialisation is mentioned in the rules, it is marked in brackets.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Language is a Grouped Skill, thus represents many related Language Skills under a single Skill heading. Examples of the different Specialisations of Language are: Language (Bretonnian), Language (Magick), or Language (Mootish).</em></p>\n<p>When you gain an Advance in a Grouped Skill, you must allocate the Advance to an appropriate Specialisation. Sometimes the Specialisation options will be marked clearly in your Career, so you simply select one of the options on offer. In other cases — such as when a Specialisation is marked as ‘Any’, meaning you can choose one Specialisation — you will need to select a Specialisation yourself; should this be required, either refer to the relevant Skill description and choose from the sample Specialisations found there, or, with GM permission, create a unique Specialisation that fits the Skill and best suits your character. </p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Theodora has a choice of Lore (Any) in her career. When she allocates an Advance to that option, she has to decide which Lore Specialisation to take. After some deliberation, she chooses to advance her Lore (Theology), showing she has learned something of the Gods.</em></p>\n<p>Other than that, Grouped Skills are handled in exactly the same way as normal Skills, with each Specialisation handled like a unique Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has 8 Advances in the Basic Skill, Entertain (Singing), but nothing in Entertain (Acting). This means she Tests her Fellowship of 41 when attempting to act, and Tests 49 when singing (41+8=49). By comparison, Theodora has a single Advance in the Advanced Skill Animal Training (Pigeons), but no Advances in Animal Training (Horses). This means she can use the Skill to train her pigeons to drop bombs on unsuspecting enemies, but she cannot train her horse to do the same, as she has no idea how to train horses.</em></p>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":900001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":900001}}}

The Empire’s relations with Bretonnia have not always been civil, and while the ramparts of Helmgart are no longer lined with aging skulls in elaborate helms, they most likely remain in the castle’s cellars. These days, the soldiers of Helmgart are more often called upon to patrol the pass, protecting travelers and merchants from Greenskins, bandits, and other menaces.</p>\n<p>Helmgart’s keep was carved directly out of the mountainside by Dwarfs long ago. Three tiers of stout stone walls buttress a great granite mountain, dominating the surrounding terrain and oﬀering an excellent view of the road below. Adjoining Helmgart proper, is a huge, imposing wall broken only by a single, long tunnel standing between the two, sheer mountainsides: the only route through to Bretonnia. Amongst the troops garrisoning the fortress are a number of storied regiments. Most famously, the gunners of Mackensen’s Marauders – a Reiklander State Regiment – are well known for their deadly accuracy, a fearsome reputation perhaps aided by the lack of cover on the road below the high walls. The fortress sits at one end of the great road that leads directly to Bögenhafen, and from there onto Altdorf.</p>\n<p>As guardian of the principle trade route into the Empire from Bretonnia, Helmgart is equal parts imposing citadel and bustling trade town. Here, Bretonnian merchants barter brandy, wine, fine fabrics, arms, and armor, while their Reiklander counterparts in turn funnel their province’s goods south. The local Dwarf clans, too, trade ingots of silver, lead, and iron, along with precious pieces of Dwarf-smithed metalwork. With so many merchants and traders, the Marketplatz of Helmgart is a bustling place, rife with endless opportunities and uncounted thieves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Creature of Helmgart Tunnel</strong>: Little more than a local legend, the Creature of Helmgart Tunnel is whispered of by tipsy guards and grinning merchants to scare their Bretonnian counterparts who are forced to travel through it.

One piece of damning evidence is that a merchant — Poncet Discret — recently fled the tunnel in terror, leaving behind his goods. When he returned to collect them, they were nowhere to be found.

One group of these stones, called the Crowstones, has a particularly foul reputation, and the surrounding bog is permanently blackened.

Near the centre, the Reikwald recedes from the stony crags and layers of stratified rock rise to the scree-laden highlands of the Prie Ridge. A single road crosses the gentler slopes of the Skaag Hills to the south, starting at Trosreut in the shadow of @Scene[RQQBIZT9OyHMFL27]{Castle Grauenberg} and wending its way through to Holthausen, but many minor tracks and trails also cross the region, most of which started as goat tracks.</p>\n<p>Once, the hillsides were bustling with small mines boasting rich veins of silver and iron. Down through the centuries most of these played out, leaving many abandoned settlements, many of which the forest reclaimed.

Desperate to bring some new blood to her dwindling village, she’s not only announced a newly discovered vein of silver in the nearby <strong>Skaag Hills</strong>, but, in her enthusiasm, sold several claims to mine it. But no such vein exists, and the miners are already on their way by the score. However, Femeke isn’t a woman to let pesky facts interrupt her fabricated silver rush. Using her new-found wealth, she employed Eldruc Ironeye — an eccentric Dwarf prospector — to search for a genuine silverlode before the miners return. So, Femeke’s in need of a few capable hands to protect her prospector from wild animals, Beastmen, Greenskins, and, Eldruc’s wife and her three brothers, who demand he come home and work off his debts.

{"_id":"EbwOpdSrBetwXypd","name":"Wood Elves","content":"<p>Wood Elves are a rare sight in the Reikland, and for good reason. During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving ‘Wood Elves’ culturally very different to their High Elf cousins. </p>\n<p>Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed with spirits of the forest. They are separatists who work hard to hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed with powerful illusions and misleading magics. On the rare occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other peoples of the Old World deeply unsure of the fae, capricious Elves.</p>\n<p>There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The ‘Asrai’ from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland.</p>\n<p>The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive, and rarely venture beyond their borders. However, a decade ago, Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren. In response, the King and Queen of the Wood, recognising the fate of their forests may lay in the hands of outsiders, sent tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting the enemies of the forest at the source. </p>\n<p>These ferocious bands are sometimes led by a spellsinger who calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos. Occasionally, these wild hunters perceive some common cause with other Old Worlders and an individual may step from the shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the Queen of the Laurelorn takes a very different path to the foretellings given to her and has recently sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the Amber Hills just south of Altdorf. These Elves observe Human politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally intervene on matters deemed important. The camp is viewed as a ‘temporary’ solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word is very different to the long-lived species. Because of this camp, these Wood Elves are a growing presence in Reikland as they venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable purposes, often as hunters or entertainers.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans…</h4>\n<p>‘I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a complete disrespect for order. But they are widespread, warlike, and, most importantly, easy to manipulate. Given winter draws near, it is time to use them.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Algwyllmyr Twiceseen, Seer from Athel Loren</p>\n<h4>On Dwarfs…</h4>\n<p>‘More stubborn than the Oak of Ages, they understand one argument only: force. So, use it swiftly and decisively, and be aware they will return for petty vengeance at a later date.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Meridrynda Aspengate, Glade Rider from Athel Loren</p>\n<h4>On Halflings…</h4>\n<p>‘I met one when travelling Middenland during the ninth year of Queen Marrisith. It talked a lot. And I do mean a lot. When we parted ways by a town it told me was named “Delberz”, I found it had somehow managed to steal several pouches of herbs from my belt. I was impressed. So, I suggest not trusting the things, but the companionship and local lore they share may be worth the cost!’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Alafael Harrowlay, Entertainer from the Laurelorn</p>\n<h4>On High Elves…</h4>\n<p>‘Conceited beyond any sensible measure, don’t approach the Asur. They are jaded, arrogant, and likely lost to Atharti. And if they try to look down on you in that superior manner they so prefer, just remind them their Queen in Avelorn lives a life no different to ours.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Cynwrawn Fartrack, Hunter from the Laurelorn</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Sylvan Cousins</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Wood Elves of Athel Loren and the Laurelorn may share a common history and origin in the Old World, but they are culturally different. Unlike the High Elves, neither of the Wood Elven kiths care much for any form of conventional civilisation, seeing it as a threat to their beloved forests and way of life. However, they differ in how they choose to express this. </em></p>\n<p><em>The Laurelorn Wood Elves proactively engage in politics to protect themselves, mixing with others, and are not above stoking the fires of hatred between other groups to shift focus to their preferred targets. Thus, in character, they are more like the High Elves, whilst still having the Skills and Talents of the Wood Elves. </em></p>\n<p><em>By comparison, the Athel Loren kinbands prefer to hide in the shadows, shunning contact with all others, instead striking deadly blows designed to cause fear and terror in the hearts of any who would look to the forest with greed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/hunter.webp","folder":"EL733FhLD2hsJ3gL","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Species"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Species","sort":500001}}}
{"_id":"FX9rb0LL6BStC7T8","name":"Career Advancement","content":"<p><em>‘Well, I play a character with no class at all who would sell his grandmother for career advancement; you know, exactly the type of fellow frequently encountered in my line of work.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Detlef Sierck, Playwright and Actor</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"> </p>\n<p>Your Career is your job when not off adventuring (or having adventures done to you, as may often be the case). It describes your training, social class, and your future prospects. <strong>WFRP </strong>groups similar Careers into Classes.</p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>A summary of each Class is found in @JournalEntry[qiN0uSuMBBPqpc64]{Class And Career}. Classes organise Careers into easily referenced groups. They also impact character development, provide different starting Trappings during Character Creation, and influence how you can change Career (see Changing Career). Some Classes have access to different Endeavours — activities you can take between adventures.</p>\n<p>The summary and illustration at the top of the eight Careers in your chosen Class should give you a good idea of which is the one for you. The Careers can be considered to be as broad as possible, so you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively as part of your Character concept.</p>\n<h3>Career Levels</h3>\n<p>Every Career has four levels, each progressively better than the last. If you take a look at Apothecary, the first Academic Career, you can see the four levels are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Apprentice Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Master Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Apothecary-General</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When choosing a Career for a new character, you always start at the first level of the career — so, if you were an Apothecary, you would start as an Apprentice Apothecary. </p>\n<h3>Advancing Through Your Career</h3>\n<p>Your Character’s Career affects how they will grow through experience. Every Career offers three forms of Advances: Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances, and Talent Advances — each of which are purchased with Experience Points (XP). You can also use XP to Change Career. Your Career Level determines what Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available to you.</p>\n<h4>Characteristic Advances</h4>\n<p>Every Career has an Advance Scheme governing its Characteristic Advances. The Advance Scheme shows your character’s 10 Characteristics, 3 marked with <strong>I</strong>, 1 marked with <strong>II</strong>, 1 marked with <strong>III</strong>, and the last marked with <strong>IV</strong>.</p>\n<p>The three marked <strong>I</strong> are Characteristics you can advance in the first level of the Career. When you enter the second level of a career, the <strong>II </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. When you enter the third level, the <strong>III </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. And when you enter the fourth and last level of a Career, the <strong>IV</strong> Characteristic finally becomes available.</p>\n<p>The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is shown by hovering over the advancement indicator (the plus symbol), and depends on the number of Characteristic Advances you have already taken in that Characteristic.</p>\n<p>Each Characteristic Advance adds +1 to the associated Characteristic. So, if you had purchased 4 Agility Advances, and your Initial Agility was 27, your Current Agility would be 31. The Advances would cost 25 XP per +1 Advance, as at each point the number of Advances previously taken would be in the 0–5 range.</p>\n<p>There is no upper limit to the number of Characteristic Advances that can be purchased, although higher levels do become prohibitively expensive. <strong>Note</strong>: While Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill have the word ‘Skill’ in them, this is only a historical artefact — they are characteristics and are Advanced as such.</p>\n<h4>Skill Advances</h4>\n<p>You can advance all the Skills listed for your Career level and lower. So, if you were an Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1), you could only access the Skills listed under Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1). But, if you were a Master Apothecary (level 3), you could access all the Skills for Master Apothecary (level 3), Apothecary (level 2), and Apprentice Apothecary (level 1).</p>\n<p>The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is shown by hovering over the advancement indicator and depends on the number of Skill Advances you have already taken in that Skill.</p>\n<p>Each Skill Advance adds +1 to your Skill level. Therefore, if you had purchased 9 Advances in Stealth and your Agility was 31, your Stealth would be 40. The first 5 Advances would cost 10 XP each, and the 4 remaining Advances would cost 15 XP each.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Skills in the first level of your Career will be marked in italics. This is the Skill you Test when @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Status} money. </p>\n<p>Like Characteristic Advances, there is no upper limit to the number of Skill Advances that can be purchased.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Non-Career Advances</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characters will inevitably want to advance Characteristics and Skills not listed in their Careers. That’s fine, if the GM feels it’s appropriate, but it costs double. The GM might want you to find a teacher or otherwise play out this unusual education. </em></p>\n<p><em>Non-Career Characteristic and Skill Advances cost double the amount of XP listed in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table.</em></p>\n<p><em>Normally, non-Career Talents may not be purchased with XP, although Training and Unusual Learning Endeavours in Chapter 6: Between Adventures provide an opportunity to purchase non-Career Advances as if they were Career Advances, and give the possibility of learning non-Career Talents.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Talent Advances</h4>\n<p>Talents are only available when you are in the level of the Career that lists them. So, if you are an Apothecary-General, you can only buy Talents listed under Apothecary-General, not those listed under Apprentice Apothecary, Apothecary, or Master Apothecary.</p>\n<p><strong>Talents Advances cost 100 XP +100 XP per Advance already taken in that Talent.</strong></p>\n<p>The first time you purchase a new Talent (for 100 XP) it grants you access to the Talent’s special rules. If you purchase a Talent multiple times (second time costs 200 XP, third 300 XP) any additional abilities bestowed are listed in the Talent description.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all Talents can be purchased multiple times. Check the Talent listing for any limitations.</p>\n<h3>Changing Career</h3>\n<p>When you have taken all the Advances you want in your current Career, it’s time to change Career. Changing Career means one of two things: </p>\n<p>1)<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Moving to a different level within your current Career (from Apothecary to Master Apothecary ); or</p>\n<p>2)<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Moving to an entirely new Career (from Apothecary to Scholar).</p>\n<p>In each case, you will have to first determine if you have completed your current Career level. If you have, changing Career costs 100 XP. If you have not, it costs 200 XP.</p>\n<h4>Completing a Career</h4>\n<p>Completing a Career represents mastering your current vocation and being ready to move on to something new. To complete a Career, you must have the number of Advances listed below in all your Career level’s Characteristics and in eight of your Career level’s available Skills. You must also have at least 1 Talent from your current Career level. Skills and Talents you have gained from advancement prior to entering your current Career count towards this..</p>\n<table style=\"height:109px;width:19.0642%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">Advances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just because you have completed a Career level does not mean you have to move to a new one. Moving Career is always entirely up to you. If you wish to stay in the first level of Pauper forever, that’s completely fine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Customize Your Trappings</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Trappings listed in each Career are guidelines only. Feel free to be creative with your Trappings, choosing those that fit your interpretation of your character’s Career and how it manifests. So, if you were using the Soldier Career to represent a grizzled Handgunner from reikland’s State Army, you may decide to tweak the required Trappings to include powder and shot. </em></p>\n<p><em>Trappings are how you are recognised as someone belonging to your career. if you want to go incognito, you might not want to have all your trappings with you. Similarly, if you are trying to use the authority of your Career, not having the trappings of such means people might not take you seriously.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Changing to a New Level</h4>\n<p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the next Career level, or any lower Career level, for 100 XP. So, if you completed Hunter (Hunter level 2), you could exit to Tracker (Hunter level 3) or Trapper (Hunter level 1) for 100 XP, but not Huntsmaster (Hunter level 4).</p>\n<p>With GM permission, you can also skip Career levels. This is normally driven by in-game events. For example: A Scion (Noble level 1) inherits a significant estate during play, so the GM offers Noble Lord (Noble level 4) as a potential change of Career. Like normal, changing to this Career level costs 100 XP if you have completed your current Career level, or 200 XP if you have not.</p>\n<h4>Changing to a New Career</h4>\n<p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the first level of any Career from your Class for 100 XP, or for 200 XP if you have not completed your current Career level. If you want to enter the first level of a Career from a different Class, this cost an extra 100 XP. Note: your GM may require in-game justification for such Career changes; after all, not just anyone can enter Noble, even if you are in the Courtier Class.</p>\n<p>Further, if you have completed your current Career level, with GM permission, and solid justification, you can enter the same Career level in any Career within your Class. So, if you completed Master Apothecary (Apothecary level 3), you could move to Fellow (Scholar level 3), to show you were taking a teaching position in Altdorf University. This costs 100 XP. However, be aware there are obvious limitations here. Some Careers, such as Wizard, require the basics be learned before the more advanced lore can be understood and the Talents of earlier Career levels will not be open to you at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, between adventures, you can also change Career using the @JournalEntry[K49RF9UtI7w5i1lY]{Changing Career}.</p>\n<table style=\"height:80px;width:63.1536%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\"><strong>Improvement</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\"><strong>XP Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">+1 Talent Advance </td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">100 XP + 100 XP Per time the Talent is already taken</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">Leave a Complete Career</td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">100 XP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">Leave an Incomplete Career</td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">200 XP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">Enter a different Class</td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">+100 XP</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":200001}}}

Like that time half way up the Bögen when Olaf jumped into a tree but missed and hit that jagged branch square on. I think he’s there still, although there’s probably not much of him left after the animals had a season’s grazing. By Sigmar’s grace, sit yourself down and have some cheese, there’s nothing good for you out there!’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter Käsegeier}, Cheesemonger, ex-Adventurer</p>\n<p>When your character takes an action, the GM will let you know what happens next. Sometimes, the GM will make a call based on your abilities and any other factors and decide that you achieved what you were attempting, or that you didn’t. If the GM isn’t sure of the outcome, or if the situation is significant or dangerous, they can resolve the action using the rules. There are a few options, as the Using Tests box shows. Tests compare a dice roll to one of the characteristics or skills on your character sheet and provide an outcome.</p>\n<h3>Simple Tests</h3>\n<p>Simple Tests are used when you need to determine if your character succeeds or fails at a simple task. Does Molli leap the churning stream? Can Wilhelm charm a lower price from the truculent merchant? Often, a quick yes or no answer to these questions allows your adventure to progress swiftly. The exception to this is when a failure would significantly impact the progress of the adventure, in which case you should use a Dramatic Test instead.</p>\n<p>To perform a Simple Test, you roll d100 and compare the result rolled to the Skill or Characteristic best suited to the action you are attempting. </p>\n<p><strong>Note </strong>this test may be modified by the GM if it is notably easy or hard to complete (see @JournalEntry[48AQuLalfmBgrGvg]{Difficulty}).</p>\n<p>If you roll lower or equal to the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s outcome is a success, and your Character performs the task.</p>\n<p>If you roll higher than the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s outcome is a failure, and your Character does not perform the task.</p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome of the Test, after testing, the GM should describe what just happened so everyone understands how the Test has impacted the story.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Failure and Success</h3>\n<p>No matter how skilled or talented a character is, there is always a chance of failure. Equally, there is always a chance of success in <strong>WFRP</strong>, no matter the odds stacked against you. </p>\n<p>If you roll 96–00 on any Test, it is always a failure. A failure occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is 96 or higher. Similarly, if you roll 01–05 on a Test, it is always a success. A success occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is less than 01–05.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Autosuccess? Not At My Table!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Not everybody likes a 5% chance of auto-success on any Test. Similarly, not everyone likes the same chance of auto-failures. If this describes you, then simply change the numbers to your taste. The most common alternative is 96–00 always fails, and 01 always succeeds.</em></p>\n<h3><em>Options: Tests Above 100%</em></h3>\n<p><em>Having exceptional abilities makes it quite possible that a modified Characteristic or Skill may be 100% or higher when tested. If this occurs in your game, you may wish to use the following optional rule to help represent such an awesome figure.</em></p>\n<p><em>A successful Test gains a bonus of +1 SL for each full 10% a tested Characteristic or Skill exceeds 100%.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz has a Charm Skill of 115%: her Fellowship characteristic of 80% plus her Charm advances of +35% (see @JournalEntry[FX9rb0LL6BStC7T8]{Advances} for more on this); thus, if she succeeds at a Charm Test, she gains a bonus of +1 SL over an above what she earns by rolling or from any applicable Talents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Dramatic Tests</h3>\n<p>Simply knowing if you pass or fail is not always enough; sometimes, it is useful to know how well you succeed or how badly you fail a Test. This is especially the case when pitching your Skills against another (see Opposed Tests), which is often the case for magic and combat. So, when you want to know exactly how well or badly you have performed a Test, use a Dramatic Test.  Another reason for choosing a Dramatic Test is when the progress of the adventure could depend on the Test. Dramatic Tests provide outcomes rather than straight success or failure, which means that even if the test is ‘failed’ the adventure continues, albeit in a more challenging way than if you had achieved a success. Dramatic Tests are handled in the same way as Simple Tests, and still provide success or failure as outcomes, but the results have more detail. This detail is governed by Success Levels. </p>\n<h4>Success Levels</h4>\n<p>Success Levels (shortened to SL) are used to describe the effectiveness of a Test. To determine the SL of a Test, subtract the 10s number of the rolled dice from the 10s number of the Characteristic or Skill being tested, including any modifiers (see Difficulty for more on modifiers). The higher the SL, the better the outcome; the lower it is, the worse things have gone. Marginal results, where you succeed or fail a Test with +0 or –0 SL, could either be interpreted as succeeding or failing by a whisker, with minimal consequences either good or bad, or could give inconclusive results allowing you try again. </p>\n<p>Exactly how well you succeed or fail is shown in the Outcomes Table, which can be used to inspire descriptions of what just happened. Much like simple tests offer a yes or no in answer to ‘do I succeed at this test?’, dramatic tests also provide answers, just more of them.</p>\n<p>If you automatically succeed due to rolling 01–05, you score +1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>If you automatically fail due to rolling 96–00, you score –1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Eichengard is careering across muddy fields atop his stallion, desperately fleeing the lands of a disgruntled noble when a wall blocks his passage. He decides to push his mount to jump, and the GM calls for a Dramatic Ride (Horse) test. Eichengard rolls 29 against his Ride (Horse) skill of 41. The 10s number of </em><em>the Skill being tested is 4, and the 10s number rolled was 2, so the test succeeds with +2 SL (4–2=2) and he clears the wall with space to spare. Buoyed by his success, Eichengard twists around in his saddle and makes the sign of the twin-tailed comet at the horsemen pursuing him. Unfortunately, this means he’s not paying attention to where he’s going. The GM calls for a Dramatic Perception Test, and Eichengard’s player rolls 82, significantly higher than Eichengard’s Perception skill of 39. The 10s number of the roll is 8, and the 10s number of the skill being tested is 3, so the test has failed with –5 SL (3–8=–5). He has failed rather badly. As Eichengard laughs at the increasingly distant guards sent to capture him, a low-lying branch slams hard into his side, knocking him flying. </em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Fast SL</em></h3>\n<p><em>Determining your SL involves some simple mathematics, so calculating it can slow play during fraught scenes. Fortunately, there is a fast way to calculate SL for those looking to keep their games as fast as possible. When you pass a Test, use the result of the tens die as your SL. So, if you passed a Test with a roll of 36, you score +3 SL. With this optional rule, the closer you roll to your tested Skill, the better, rather than rolling low being best. If a Test fails, you calculate SL as normal, taking your rolled tens die from your tested Skill to determine your negative SL.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Outcomes Table</h3>\n<table style=\"width:99.0712%;height:158px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\"><strong>SL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>Have You Succeeded?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:33px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:30px\">+6 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:30px\">Astounding Success</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:30px\"><strong>Yes, perfectly!</strong>: The result is as good as it can be, perhaps with extra luck and fortunate coincidences thrown in!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">+4 to +5</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Impressive Success</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>Yes, and…:</strong> You achieve your goal with style, exceeding your expectations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">+2 to +3</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Success</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>Yes</strong>: You achieve a solid success.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">+0 to +1</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Marginal Success</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>Yes, but…:</strong> You more or less achieve what you intend, but imperfectly, and perhaps with an unpredictable side effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">-1 to -0</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Marginal Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>No, but…:</strong> You marginally fail, perhaps accomplishing a portion of what you intended.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">-2 to -3</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>No</strong>: You just plain do it wrong.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">-4 to -5</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Impressive Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\"><strong>No, and…</strong>: Not only do you mess up, but you also cause additional things to go wrong.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:9.21875%;height:16px\">-6 or less</td>\n<td style=\"width:20.7813%;height:16px\">Astounding Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width:69.0625%;height:16px\">\n<p><strong>No, not in any way!</strong>: Everything goes wrong in the worst possible way.

They can also be used to add drama for all Tests, creating a game that feels epic in scope as extreme results become commonplace. If that describes your group, you could use the following optional rule.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:normal\">Any Test scoring a success that also rolls a double is called a Critical, meaning you’ve scored an Astounding Success from the Outcome Table; and any failure including a double is a Fumble, resulting in an Astounding Failure from the Outcome Table. This optional rule works well with Simple Tests, providing a fun addition to the yes or no results offered there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Not all Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is laughably easy but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is incredibly tough. To represent this, the GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Tests called the Difficulty . While published adventures define the difficulty for the GM — for example: calling for a <strong>Hard (–20) Research</strong> test — there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the fly. Making judgments like this is one of the most common functions of the GM. For each Test, whether simple or dramatic, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult the Difficulty Table to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extreme situations. </p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Valentyn, a Jade Wizard, tries to find the tracks of an unruly stag he is hunting. Under normal circumstances, he would perform an <strong>Average (+20) Track</strong> Test with his skill of 41, thus test against 61; however, the GM decides that as the rain last night washed away most of the tracks the task is Very Hard and imposes a –30 penalty. Therefore, Valentyn has to roll 11 or under (41–30=11) to succeed. He rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this circumstance is a failure, indicating the rain has foiled the Jade Wizard’s attempt.</em></p>\n<h4>Opposed Tests</h4>\n<p>Sometimes you match your capabilities directly against those of an opponent. The rules represent this with a special Dramatic Test called an Opposed Test. Opposed Tests are an important part of <strong>WFRP’s </strong>combat rules later in this chapter, but are used in many other situations, as well.</p>\n<p>An Opposed Test is handled just like any other Dramatic Test, but both parties make a Test. The party with the highest SL wins the Test. If both participants score the same SL, the party with the higher tested Skill or Characteristic wins. In the unlikely event there is still a tie, then one of two things, as determined by the GM, occurs: 1) there is a stalemate, and nothing happens; 2) both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Having floored an important Reiklander baron at a party, Salundra makes to leave the ballroom; however, some uneasy guardsmen block her passage, knowing they really should detain the noble captain. Salundra scowls as she approaches. </em></p>\n<p><em>The GM calls for an Intimidate Test and opposes it with the guardsmen’s commanding officer’s Leadership Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Salundra’s Intimidate is 47. The officer’s Leadership is 46. Salundra rolls a 04, scoring +4 SL (4–0=4), while the GM rolls 16, scoring +3 SL (4–1=3). As Salundra’s SL is higher (4 to the officer’s 3), she successfully intimidates the guards, who let her pass with barely a grumble.</em></p>\n<p>Like any other Tests, some Opposed Tests are easier or harder than others, so the GM may decide modifiers are required. In most cases, these modifiers are applied equally to both sides, but not always. If no Difficulty is marked for an Opposed Test, it is assumed to be <strong>Challenging (+0).</strong> </p>\n<p>If it is important to know how well the winner of the Opposed Test won, use the difference between the two results to determine a final SL.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> It’s Pie Week, an annual week-long festival for everyone’s favourite baked goods, and Salundra has entered a pie-eating contest. She’s reached the final, and it’s her versus Fat Tom Brandysnap, the Ubersreik Pie Eating Champion for the last 5 years running, and a Halfling wider than he is tall. </em></p>\n<p><em>The GM calls for an Opposed Endurance Test. Salundra has an Endurance of 45 and Fat Tom has 63. Salundra is possibly in trouble! Dice roll, and Salundra rolls 51, scoring –1 SL. Sali’s looking a little green! But Fat Tom’s looking worse! He rolls 91 for –3 SL. So, even though she’s failed her Endurance roll, she still wins the Opposed Test by 2 SL, though she’ll probably be bringing up most of those pies later!</em></p>\n<h4>Extended Tests</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the adventure will call for a specific number of Success Levels be achieved to fully succeed at a time-consuming or especially taxing task. Doing this requires a special Dramatic Test called an Extended Test. Extended Tests are handled in the same fashion as any other Dramatic Test, but the SL scored from multiple rolls are added together to reach a specified target. If the total SL scored ever falls below 0, you can start again from scratch with the next roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: On the run again, Molli is attempting to pick an unexpectedly complex lock before she is discovered. The GM states the lock requires 5 Success Levels with a Challenging (+0) Pick Lock Test to pry open, and that she only has three Rounds before the guard arrives. Molli’s Pick Lock skill is 58, so she has a good chance of managing it, but time isn’t on her side. Unfortunately for her, her first Test scores 63: –1 SL and a terrible start, she’s made no progress and will start from scratch next round.  Cursing under her breath as footsteps draw closer, Molli tries again, this time scoring 11, for +4 SL! She feels tension in her picks as the lock almost springs, but she also hears the approaching guard is even closer. </em></p>\n<p><em>The GM explains the next Test is the last one before the guard arrives, so Molli can either abandon her attempt and avoid the guard or make a desperate effort to secure the last SL she needs to pick the lock. Knowing she needs to escape, Molli risks the last Test and rolls, scoring… 42! That’s +1 SL, taking her to a total of 5. The lock opens with a click! Triumphant, Molli slips through the door and closes it behind her just before the guard arrives.</em></p>\n<h3>Assistance</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[7twc3jS1XKVS8KI4]{Assistance}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Combining Skills</em></h3>\n<p><em>Sometimes, you may be in a situation where you feel two Skills should be tested by the same character for a single task, so it may be appropriate to combine those Skills for a single Test. There are generally two reasons to do this: 1) is faster and limits the number of dice rolls required to press on with the game; 2) having to pass two Tests in a row to perform a single task significantly reduces your chance of passing overall.</em></p>\n<p><em>The simplest way to do this is to attempt both Skills with one Test, comparing a single percentile roll to each Skill number. If both pass, you succeed at the Test. If only one passes, you partially pass as appropriate. And, obviously, if both fail, you have failed the Test. </em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>After a string of unlikely events, Salundra finds herself on-stage in yellow and red tights, singing and dancing in the Vargr Breughel Memorial Playhouse’s inaugural production of ‘Tell Me On A Festag’. The GM calls for a <strong>Challenging Combined Perform (Dance) and Entertain (Sing)</strong> Test, thinking it unfair Salundra should have to enact each Test in turn as that would significantly reduce her overall chance of success. Salundra has Perform (Dance) at 53 from her time in court, but doesn’t have Entertain (Sing), so must use her Fellowship of 43. She then rolls 46, meaning she managed the dance (succeeded with +1 SL), but hit a few off-notes with her singing (failed at -0 SL) — not perfect, but good enough for the gathered crowds; though Kym Neumann, the Altdorf Spieler’s theatre critic, may not be writing a favourable review...</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":1100001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":1100001}}}

{"_id":"G6Y8TD1355K5pVvl","name":"The Gods","content":"<p>Signs of religion are everywhere in the Old World, from the magnificent temples in the great cities to the humble wayside shrines and household altars. Old Worlders do their best to stay on the right side of their gods.</p>\n<p>High-ranking clerics are wealthy and powerful, wielding as much influence and prestige as the greatest nobles. At the other end of the scale, village priests tend to the spiritual needs of rural communities, preaching the tenets of their faith and interceding with their patron deities on behalf of their flocks. Several faiths also support templar orders: these private armies of priest-soldiers answer to the head of their faith rather than to any noble or elector count, which can cause significant political friction.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Gods</strong></h2>\n<p>The people of the Old World recognise many deities. Some are worshipped across the whole of the Old World; some are restricted to one nation or region; and some are patrons of just a single town or occupation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Gods Of The Empire</strong></h3>\n<p>In the Empire, the pantheon of gods is split into three broad categories: the Old Gods, the Classical Gods, and the Provincial Gods. Standing apart from these is Sigmar, the first Emperor, and patron deity of the Empire as a whole.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Old Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Old Gods refer to the pantheon of deities worshipped when the Empire was unbroken forest populated by wandering tribes of barbarians. Many Old Gods stood as patrons to one of the tribes, and to this day some are still associated with the old geographical hunting grounds of those ancient peoples. Although few say so out loud, many citizens of the Empire regard the Old Gods as the true deities of the Empire, and the Classical Gods as relative newcomers.</p>\n<p>As time passed, five gods rose to prominence amongst the Old Gods, worshipped by dominant cults spread from one end of the Empire to the other: Ulric, Taal, Rhya, Manaan, and Morr, representing the primal spheres of war, nature, fertility, seas, and death.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Classical Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Classical Gods spread from the southern lands of Tilea, Estalia, and the Border Princes through trade and diplomatic contact. Today, their worship is popular in the cosmopolitan towns and cities, and some nobles and townsfolk secretly regard them as more sophisticated than the Old Gods — though few would risk voicing such opinions aloud!</p>\n<p>The most widespread cults of Classical Gods in the Empire are dedicated to Verena, Myrmidia, Shallya, and Ranald, patrons of wisdom, strategy, mercy, and trickery. Hiding behind these, there is also Khaine, the God of Murder, though his cult is outlawed in most places.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Provincial Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Empire hosts a wide variety of deities — patrons of provinces, towns, forests, lakes, rivers, crafts, and much more besides. Formed into complicated pantheons by local legends and myths, the Provincial Gods often have small cults dedicated to them, but few have much influence. However, there are exceptions: standing high above other Provincial Gods, worship of Handrich, the God of Trade, has spread significantly with commerce and now boasts a significant cult-presence amongst the Empire’s rising merchant class.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sigmar</strong></h4>\n<p>Sigmar founded the Empire over two-thousand years ago, and his legend recounts how he conquered unthinkable foes and overcame impossible odds. Reigning for fifty years, he eventually abdicated and turned east to return his magical warhammer, Ghal-Maraz, to its forgers: his old allies, the Dwarfs. He was never seen again. Not long after, oracles and prophets claimed Sigmar had ascended to godhood, invested by Ulric before the entire pantheon of old gods and new.</p>\n<p>Today, many centuries later, the cult of Sigmar, patron of the Empire, has spread to such an extent that its leader, the Grand Theogonist, is arguably more powerful than the emperor himself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Gods of the Reikland</strong></em></p>\n<table style=\"height:115px;width:573px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:34px\"><em>Bögenauer</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:34px\"><em>River Bögen</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:34px\"><em>Boatmen, Merchants, and Bögenhafeners</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:34px\"><em>Coins, sheaves of reeds, rolled stones</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:34px\"><em>A single temple in Bögenhafen with no full-time clerics; shrines line the river.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Borchbach</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>Rhetoric</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Agitators, politicians, lawyers</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"><em>Written speeches, acorns, quills</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Several shrines and two temples to Borchbach are found in Altdorf.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:13px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:13px\"><em>Clio</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:13px\"><em>History</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:13px\"><em>Scholars</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:13px\"><em>Fruit, honey, menses</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:13px\"><em>A significant temple to the Classical God Clio is attached to Altdorf University.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Dyrath</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>Women</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Womenfolk</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"><em>Beer, eels, silver</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Dyrath has no temples; instead, a secretive cult is spread through the villages and hamlets of the Hägercrybs.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Grandfather Reik</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>River Reik</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Merchants, bargees, fishermen</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"><em>Coins, jewellery, clothing</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Shrines dot the length of the river Reik, but there is no formal cult.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Katya</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>Disarming Beauty</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Bawds, lovers, the lonely</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Temples to Katya double as brothels in the towns of the Vorbergland.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Other Pantheons</strong></h3>\n<p>The different countries and species of the Old World all have deities of their own. Some, according to theologians, are aspects of other deities worshipped under different names. Others are particularly revered by a particular species: examples include Grungni, the Dwarfen God of Mining and Dwarf Pride; Isha, a Goddess of Fertility and Nature who is seen as the mother of all Elves; and Esmerelda, the Halfling Goddess of Hearth, Home, and Family.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Chaos Gods</strong></h3>\n<p>The Daemonic gods of the Realms of Chaos are the greatest threat to the Old World, each determined to bring absolute ruin to the mortal realm. Their worship by lost and damned souls is pervasive and clandestine, with uncounted dark cultists infiltrating all levels of society. Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh: Gods of Rage, Despair, Ambition, and Excess. Few dare whisper their twisting names, for they harbour malevolent power, and leave mutation and horror in their wake.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Cults</strong></h2>\n<h4><strong>Orders</strong></h4>\n<p>Most Old World cults are split into orders, with each order focussing on different aspects of their god’s concerns. Orders come in many different forms, including monastic orders of monks or nuns, templar orders of knights, priestly orders that attend to holy needs in the community, and mendicant orders of friars that wander the Old World, usually subsisting from alms. Each order is organised differently according to individual cult law and tradition, but in all cases they swear allegiance to the head of their cult, not the local nobility.</p>\n<h4><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h4>\n<p>The cults maintain holy sites across the Old World, many of them associated with legendary deeds of the gods from mythical times. Most are protected by buildings such as temples, abbeys, chapterhouses, or monasteries. Some older sites, or those not so well known, may only be marked by a shrine or unattended chapel. Cult buildings are usually decorated beautifully inside and out with scenes from the religion’s mythology. They vary widely in size and layout and often follow regional styles of architecture. Some hold extreme wealth, especially in the towns and cities where a more affluent population provides greater tithes. Larger cult buildings support dozens of people, including lay craftspeople, guards, and servants, while smaller sites are run by a handful of staff aided by volunteers from the community. In villages, a single priest is the norm, supported by the faithful.</p>\n<p>Shrines and chapels are more modest affairs, the size of a one-room house or smaller. They do not normally have a full-time priest, although they may come under the charge of a nearby temple or — especially in rural areas — a wandering priest who travels from one village and shrine to another. In a priest’s absence, local villagers pray unsupervised, leave small offerings, and keep the shrine in good repair.</p>\n<h3><strong>Primary Cults of the Empire</strong></h3>\n<p>Although many hundreds of gods are worshipped across the Empire, ten are of particular importance, each worshipped by cults spanning the grand provinces and granted a special position by Magnus the Pious over two-hundred years ago.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Grand Conclave</strong></h3>\n<p>When Emperor Magnus the Pious rebuilt the Empire after the Great War Against Chaos, he realised previous schisms and civil wars besetting his realm were often sourced in religious unrest. </p>\n<p>To help prevent this happening again, Magnus created the Grand Conclave, a meeting of the primary cults in the Empire held every five years to air grievances and discuss resolutions, with the emperor sitting as chair.</p>\n<p>Though enormously controversial at the time, the Grand Conclave is now fully accepted, and is held alongside great celebrations and festivities, with the representatives of the following gods required to attend: Manaan, Morr, Myrmidia, Ranald, Rhya, Shallya, Sigmar, Taal, Ulric, and Verena. Although other influential cults exist — such as the Cult of Handrich, which is currently lobbying for a seat on the Conclave — the ten currently sitting are widely perceived as the most important in the Empire.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5KE7OsW9A3UTErwU]{The Cult of Manann, God of the Sea}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[npoAggEl7Nf760vE]{The Cult of Morr, God of Death}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[p9mLWL5dhvve4nQO]{The Cult of Myrmidia, Goddes of Strategy}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[NFzckQwGMWvvhEUy]{The Cult of Ranald, God of Trickery}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2IwaKatBpKLgtBYJ]{The Cult of Rhya, Goddess of Fertility}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5UVBumUG1gBLetDB]{The Cult of Shallya, Goddess of Mercy}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[e29H7Woyzy1zoeQ1]{The Cult of Sigmar, God of the Empire}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[yUbmjj9uSiWR40j4]{The Cult of Taal, God of the Wild}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LQ2w4wBqLqxjQxsh]{The Cult of Ulric, God of War}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[mJCVmgr24GVA4b1p]{The Cult of Verena, Goddess of Wisdom}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Dwarven Ancestor Gods</h2>\n<p>The Dwarfs venerate their ancient ancestors, valuing tradition above all else. Though the Time of the Ancestor Gods was many thousands of years ago, the Dwarfs still hold records of that time in their oldest Holds. Many names echo from that era, creating a broad, inter-related pantheon, but three Ancestor Gods are of especial importance and are known by all Dwarfs: Grimnir, Grungni, and Valaya, each a progenitor of the species as a whole. In addition to the oldest Ancestor Gods, Dwarfs also revere the founders of local clans as guardian deities.</p>\n<h3>Dwarf Priests</h3>\n<p>Those dedicating themselves to the cults of the Ancestor Gods do not use the Priest, Nun, or Warrior Priest Careers, as Dwarfs have a very different relationship with their gods, seeking to emulate them rather than worship or appease them. </p>\n<p>Because of this, if you wish to play a Dwarf dedicated to one of the Ancestor Gods, simply choose an appropriate career to best act like that god. So, if you wanted to emulate Grimnir, effectively becoming a priest of Grimnir, perhaps play a Slayer and join the Cult of the Slayer, or maybe become a Soldier.</p>\n<h2>Elven Gods</h2>\n<p>The Elves worshipped their own gods long before Humans and most other species existed in their current forms. Their pantheon is extensive, with different groups of deities being held as important by Wood Elves and High Elves. </p>\n<p>Loosely, there are two groups of gods, the Cadai and the Cytharai. The Cadai rule the heavens, and have strong connections to their Elven worshippers, directly helping where they can. The selfish Cytharai rule the underworld, and care little for the Elves. Standing apart from both these courts are a loose group of unaligned gods, the most prominent being Morai-Heg the Crone, Goddess of Fate and Death.</p>\n<p>The High Elves especially revere the Cadai, and have sophisticated priesthoods dedicated to their teachings. They appease the Cytharai when necessary, but it is unlawful to worship any but Mathlann, whose aid is sought by mariners. According to their myths, Asuryan, the God of Creation, is king of all the gods, able to pronounce judgement upon them all.</p>\n<p>The Wood Elves take a much more balanced approach and have temples and shrines to all the gods impacting their lives, be they Cadai or Cytharai. Because of their close association with the woods and forests, they revere Isha the Mother and Kurnous the Hunter above all others, and rumours persist that both gods take a direct hand in Wood Elf affairs.</p>\n<p>According to some theologians — mostly Elven — the deities of this pantheon are the true gods, and those worshipped by other species are simply different aspects of the Elven originals.</p>\n<h3>Elven Priests</h3>\n<p>Both High Elves and Wood Elves have priesthoods for the gods, but they do not have blessings and miracles. The Elves don’t believe the gods manifest in this fashion, and instead see magic as a gift from the gods. Because of this, if you wish to be an Elven priest, use the Wizard career, and chose from an appropriate Lore to represent the magic your god has gifted. So, a ‘priest’ of Kurnous would use the Lore of Beasts, a worshipper of Isha, the Lore of Life, and devotees of Asuryan use the Lores of Light or Fire.</p>\n<h2>Halfling Gods</h2>\n<p>Some say that Halflings are superstitious rather than religious, and the bulk of their deities support this impression. Most Halfling gods and goddesses have to do with hearth and home, cooking, herb lore, earthy matters, and general day-to-day concerns. Halfling gods are practical rather than philosophical: as the saying goes: ‘Deep thoughts butter no parsnips’. Halflings also show respect to certain Human deities — Sigmar, Taal, and Rhya in particular — but this is more from a desire to avoid conflict than from any sincere devotion.</p>\n<h3>Halfling Priests</h3>\n<p>Halflings don’t really have priests, and they certainly don’t build temples (though Humans seem happy to do it for them, especially Sigmarites). There are better things to do than warble on about someone else’s business. Of course, they respect the gods, and have shrines on-hand should they need to have a quick natter, but none make a career exclusively talking to just one god — why make yourself so exclusive? Should a particular god need to be appeased, it is usually left up to a local elder to do what’s required on behalf of the community, often after a great deal of talking with relevant experts and peers.</p>\n<h2>Chaos Gods</h2>\n<p>The Ruinous Powers of Chaos are the foremost existential threat to the Old World, but much about them remains a mystery. Merely seeking such knowledge is punishable by death without permission from the Cult of Sigmar. And seeking such permission attracts intense scrutiny of your person and motives, and is seldom granted.</p>\n<p>The Ruinous Powers are seen by the common folk as the punishing manifestation of sin, and the reason that all must behave within socially acceptable boundaries as espoused by the cults. Indulging in violence, lust, slovenliness or unseemly curiosity has direct repercussions for the individual (as they are corrupted and come to a sticky end) and for their community, as their deviant behaviour attracts the destructive attention of these evil forces. </p>\n<p>The average person will know of the most powerful of these forces through euphemistic names, such as the Blood God, the Plague Lord, the Lord of Change, and the Prince of Pain. Even the most learned scholars of this forbidden lore can only guess at what motivates these obscene powers, or if they even have an agenda beyond their primal impulses. </p>\n<p>It seems there are competing factions dedicated to different aspects of ruin, and they are as much enemies to each other as to the rest of the Old World. On the rare occasions when they co-operate, much like they did during the Great War Against Chaos over two-hundred years ago, the world trembles. Some claim cults dedicated to the Chaos Gods have infiltrated the Empire. Most dismiss this as nonsense, for no right-thinking individual would be so foolish as to worship one of the Ruinous Powers.</p>","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":1300001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":1300001}}}

Grunberg’s walls protect the tollhouse on the south end of the canal, and any barge wishing to pass it must pay a tax based on the length of the vessel entering the canal system. Queues are common at first light and dusk, but otherwise the tollhouse sees infrequent business. At the north end there is a lock-keeper’s house on the outskirts of Prieze that doubles as a barracks and stables for the twelve road warden paid to patrol the canal path and help any barges as required. This help typically comes in the form of impromptu protection taxes, which if not paid leave the oﬀending barge open to bandit attacks. Attacks that inevitably follow for any who refuse to pay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In the Huff: </strong>Oskar Griesgram of the <strong>Buxhead </strong>Huffers’ Guild is furious. His company has always kept its numbers low, which ensured leading barges through the treacherous mouth of the Teufel scored a premium price. But the <strong>Grünberg Canal</strong> has ruined everything, as now more barges pass down that artificial waterway than through the silty waters of <strong>Leopold’s Folly</strong>. Griesgram believes it’s time for action. Obviously, he can’t involve himself, but should an interested party accidentally blow up a section of canal, or maybe lead some terrible creature to make its lair nearby, he’d be happy to part with a percentage of his wages every month, as business would surely boom in response.</li>\n</ul>","folder":"TWZmPUMqO1y8ZmP9","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rivers, Canals, and Lakes"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rivers, Canals, and Lakes","sort":200001}}}

To represent the unpredictable extremes of a life-or-death skirmish, there are Criticals — extraordinarily good hits — and Fumbles — egregious errors.</p>\n<h4>Criticals</h4>\n<p>Any successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double causes a Critical. This means you have dealt a significant blow, and it even happens when you are the defender in an opposed Test.</p>\n<p>If you score a Critical, your opponent receives an immediate Critical Wound as your weapon strikes true. Beyond that, SL is calculated as normal, as is who wins any Opposed Tests.</p>\n<h4>Fumbles</h4>\n<p>The converse of Criticals, any failed combat Test that also rolls a double is a Fumble, which means something very unfortunate has occurred. To determine what happens, roll on the @Table[oops]{Oops! Table}.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Deathblow</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some players like a heroic approach to combat, with characters able to wade through lesser foes. If this suits your style of play, use the following rule: </em></p>\n<p><em>If you kill a melee opponent in a single blow, you may move into the space the character occupied and attack another opponent if there is one available. You may keep doing this a number of times equal to your Weapon Skill Bonus, and may not attack the same Character more than once on the same Turn. Some creatures are so big they can activate this rule without killing any opponents.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Opposed Tests and Fumbles</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">During an Opposed Test, it is possible to Fumble and still win if you score a higher SL than your opponent. This is fine, and not a little hilarious, as you ineffectually tussle with your even worse opponent, potentially injuring yourself in the process.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Molli swipes her dagger at her opponent and rolls 66 for a fumble with -3 SL, but her opponent rolls 92 for -5 SL. So, Molli wins with +2 SL over her opponent, gaining +1 Advantage, which she may quickly lose as she also has to roll on the Oops! Table to see what unfortunate accident will befall her.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em>Misfires!</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your Primary Arm location using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"fB8m4sZ2E3sMgszX","sort":75001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Combat","sort":75001}}}

Alternately, you may have a ‘break’ session between adventures, where you employ these rules, and allow the Characters to explore their normal lives and pursue their own goals.

As noted in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your ‘Between Adventures’ phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless it is saved with this Endeavour. So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure. </p>\n<p><strong>Investing</strong>: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll 1d10). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued. </p>\n<p><strong>Stashing</strong>: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour. Roll 1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds. </p>\n<p>If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds secured via an Income Endeavour. </p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Gerhard and Ulli’s courage in the face of a Greenskin horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them a haul worth 10 gold crowns each.

Eventually, Morkar is slain by Sigmar in a day-long battle that was said to have split the earth and rent the sky.</p>\n<h3>c. 2 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar names the twelve tribal chiefs his ‘counts’, which modern scholars claim can be sourced in the Classical word comes, meaning ‘companion’, for they were his companions on the battlefield against the Greenskins and against the Chaos tribes from the north.</p>\n<h3>c. 7 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar kills the Necromancer Morath and takes the Crown of Sorcery. Recognising its evil, Sigmar locks it away beneath Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>11 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Battle of Drakenmoor</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, leads an army of Goblins and Daemons against Sigmar’s new capital and suffers the first defeat of his eternal existence. This shocking loss will haunt him long after he reincorporates several centuries later.</p>\n<h3>15 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Battle of the River Reik</em>. Nagash, the Lord of Undeath, gathers a shambling horde of unliving monsters, and attempts to claim the Crown of Sorcery from Sigmar. The Undead almost overwhelm the Reiklanders and their Dwarf allies, but, after an exhausting battle, Sigmar eventually strikes Nagash down, causing the unliving army to crumble to dust.</p>\n<h3>50 IC</h3>\n<p>After five decades of extraordinary rule, Sigmar vanishes. To avoid destroying Sigmar’s empire, the tribal chiefs eventually agree to vote for a new emperor from their own number, and select Siegrich of the Asoborn tribe. Thus, the counts became ‘elector counts’, and each swears to be a companion and protector of their elected emperor.</p>\n<h3>51 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Siegrich I dies in a hunting accident. After a fraught month, Prince Hedrich of the Unberogens is elected Emperor Hedrich I, bringing the seat of the Empire back to Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>69 IC</h3>\n<p>Johann Helstrum arrives in Reikdorf and claims to have holy visions concerning Sigmar. He preaches that he witnessed Sigmar’s Ascension to Godhood. Such is the love the Unberogens have for their lost emperor, Helstrum is readily believed.</p>\n<h3>73 IC</h3>\n<p>Johann Helstrum builds a temple to Sigmar in Reikdorf. History will forever remember him as the first Grand Theogonist of </p>\n<p>the Cult of Sigmar, and the first man to recognise Sigmar’s divinity.</p>\n<h3>c. 100 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Hedrich I receives the twelve runeblades from Alaric the Mad that were commissioned 100 years earlier. Each of these ‘Runefangs’ is a unique weapon of extraordinary power, and they are passed to the tribal chiefs. In time, the Runefangs will become powerful symbols of the Elector Counts.</p>\n<h3>246 IC</h3>\n<p>A High Temple to Sigmar is completed in Reikdorf, and it acts as the centre </p>\n<p>of worship for a cult that now extends throughout the Empire. This rapid expansion leads to open conflict with the cults of Ulric and Taal.</p>\n<h3>990 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Ludwig I, commonly called Ludwig the Fat, grants the Grand Theogonist a vote to select the next emperor. Though some Elector Counts cry foul, and the other cults are astounded at the blatant favouritism, Emperor Ludwig appears far more interested in the lavish banquets prepared for him by the Cult of Sigmar in Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>1000 IC</h3>\n<p>1000 years after Sigmar was crowned emperor, the Cult of Sigmar completes a new High Temple in Reikdorf. It is the largest temple in all the Empire, and cements Sigmar worship as the primary cult in the Reikland. In celebration, Emperor Ludwig </p>\n<p>I renames his city Altdorf, demonstrating its age and importance to the Empire as a whole.</p>\n<h3>1053-1115 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Rule of Boris Goldgather</em>. Emperor Boris I proves to be exceptionally unpopular and corrupt, with his rule known for exorbitant taxes, weak leadership, and a complete neglect of the military.</p>\n<h3>1106-1110 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Rise of the Drakwald</em>: Beastmen and other vile creatures swarm from beneath the twisted bowers of the Drakwald, sacking villages, towns, and fortifications across the Drakwald province. When the last heir to the Drakwald throne is slain in battle with an enormous Bestigor, Emperor Boris I chooses to place the Drakwald Runefang in his Altdorf palace. Publicly, when a suitable heir is found, the Runefang will be passed on. Privately, Boris has no intention of ever giving up the magical blade.</p>\n<h3>1111-1115 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Black Plague</em>. Disease sweeps through the Reikland, killing nine in every ten people, and debilitating half of those left alive. Skaven then erupt from their under-Empire and attack. When Emperor Boris I dies of the plague in 1115 IC, no-one replaces him in the ensuing anarchy. </p>\n<p>1115-1124 IC</p>\n<p><em>The Rat Wars</em>. Skaven move to systematically enslave the remaining population of the Empire, and effectively wipe-out what remains of the Drakwald province. In response, Elector Count Mandred of Middenland rallies a desperate defence, and with the help of Elven allies from the laurelorn Forest, finally drives the Skaven back below ground. At the end of the war, the victorious Mandred is elected emperor by the three surviving elector bloodlines.</p>\n<h3>1152-1359 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Age of Wars</em>. Emperor Mandred II is assassinated by the Skaven in 1152 IC. The Elector Counts cannot agree on a successor as they are too concerned about rivals invading their devastated grand provinces, so a fraught interregnum ensues for over two centuries. During this time, the Princes of the Reikland rule their Grand Province unfettered as civil war rages across the Empire.</p>\n<h3>1359-1547 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Time of Two Emperors</em>. In a desperate bid to end the bloodshed, the Electors meet in Altdorf and eventually agree on a choice for emperor, crowning Elector Count Wilhelm of Stirland as emperor by a majority of one. Elector Countess Ottila of Talabecland is outraged at this, and claims the vote is rigged. When she returns to Talabheim she declares herself Empress without a vote, and is supported in her claim by the Cults of Taal and Ulric. She then outlaws the Cult of Sigmar in Talabecland, a decree that stands for almost a thousand years. The civil wars escalate.</p>\n<h3>1421 IC</h3>\n<p>Shipbuilding rises to prominence in Altdorf’s natural harbour, the Reiksport. Soon, quality vessels built in the Reikland are plying the Reik river system.</p>\n<h3>1489 IC</h3>\n<p>The prince of the Reikland formally commissions a navy, worried about the influence of ships sailing from Talabheim, Carroburg, Nuln, and Marienburg. To help limit their influence, Altdorf builds several low bridges across the Reik and Talabec to block larger ships and to control trade.</p>\n<h3>1547-1979 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Time of Three Emperors</em>. After Sigmarites botch an assassination attempt when Electors refuse to back their choice for the next emperor, the Elector Count of Middenland denounces the imperial elections as a corrupt sham, and declares himself the rightful emperor. He has the support of the cult of Ulric, which had recently fallen out with the Talabecland emperors. </p>\n<p>The Empire now has three Emperors: The Electoral Emperor supported by the cult of Sigmar, the Ottilian Emperor supported by the Cult of Taal, and the Wolf Emperor supported by the Cult of Ulric. The civil wars intensify. </p>\n<h3>c. 1450-1550 IC</h3>\n<p>Knights returning rich from the crusades against Araby found new knightly orders and chapterhouses across the Reikland. They also fund the first temple of Myrmidia in Altdorf, a simple building sponsored by the newly invested Knights of the Blazing Sun.</p>\n<h3>1681 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Night of the Restless Dead</em>. The dead stir in the Gardens of Morr. Corpses rise, bones rattle, and the dead walk the land, sowing terror and confusion. Entire towns and villages are overrun before dawn brings a reprieve from the rapacious hunger of the deceased.</p>\n<h3>1707-1712 IC</h3>\n<p><em>WAAAGH! Gorbad!</em> and the First Siege of Altdorf. Taking advantage of the divided Empire, the Orc Warboss Gorbad Ironclaw invades with a tide of Greenskins at his back, destroying the Grand Province of Solland, sacking Nuln and much of Wissenland, and eventually sweeping through the Reikland razing almost a third of its settlements before his green wave eventually breaks against the walls of Altdorf; but not before the Prince of Altdorf, and Electoral Emperor, Sigismund IV is killed.</p>\n<h3>1940 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Poisoned Feast</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, in one of his most famous treacheries, invites the Electoral Emperor, Carolus II, and the entire imperial court and its families, to a great feast held in his castle. Drachenfels poisons his guests, paralysing them. He then starves them to death in front of the marvellous banquet he prepared. This wipes out several important noble bloodlines of the Reikland, deeply destabilising the grand province and the Electoral Emperors as a whole.</p>\n<h3>1979-2303 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Dark Ages</em>. Elector Countess Magritta of Westerland is elected empress, but the Cult of Sigmar refuses to crown her, or indeed any other Elector Count or Countess, leaving the Electoral Emperors without a voted emperor. The entire electoral system collapses, and soon most provinces fight only for themselves. Petty warlords claim titles on a whim as new kingdoms, counties, duchies, princedoms and more rise and fall as terror spreads across the former Empire.</p>\n<h3>2010-2146 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Vampire Wars.</em> The Empire has collapsed into thousands of competing factions, and the Vampire Lords of Sylvania rise to exploit the turmoil. In total, three major wars result as three different vampire counts attempt to eradicate the fractured Empire. Each time, the Vampires are driven back through a mixture of unlikely alliances, desperate gambits, and clever strategy.</p>\n<h3>2051 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Second Siege of Altdorf</em>. The vampire lord Vlad von Carstein is slain. His wife, Isabella von Carstein, commits suicide, unable to continue unlife without him. Their armies soon splinter into feuding factions, ending the First Vampire Wars.</p>\n<h3>2100 IC</h3>\n<p>After the inconclusive Battle of Four Armies ended in multiple assassination attempts by supposed allies on the Empire side, it is decided that it is time to elect an emperor to pull everyone together. Elector Count Helmut is the most popular candidate for this, until its discovered he is actually a zombie in the thrall of Konrad von Carstein, the very vampire lord they are trying to defeat. All plans to elect an emperor are abandoned.</p>\n<h3>2135 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Third Siege of Altdorf</em>. The vampire lord Mannfred von Carstein launches a surprise winter attack on the Reikland capital as it recuperated from a summer of civil conflicts but is eventually driven back when the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar uses a forbidden spell to unbind the vampire’s necromancy.</p>\n<h3>2203 IC</h3>\n<p>A rift into the Realms of Chaos opens at Castle Drachenfels, resulting in the annihilation of almost every living soul from Bögenhafen to Ubersreik. After more than a week of terror, the rift mysteriously closes.</p>\n<h3>2302-2304 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Great War Against Chaos. </em>Asavar Kul, Everchosen of Chaos, leads a horde of unimaginable size into Kislev, laying waste to everything in his path. In response, Magnus von Bildhofen, a young Nulner noble claiming to be inspired by Sigmar, rallies the fractured and broken Empire into a mighty army to relieve Kislev. He eventually defeats Asavar Kul at the Gates of Kislev alongside Kislevite, Dwarf, and Elven allies.</p>\n<h3>2304-2369 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Reign of Magnus the Pious</em>. Magnus von Bildhofen is elected Emperor Magnus I, the first elected emperor representing all Sigmar’s Grand Provinces for almost a thousand years. Riding the wave of popularity he secured by winning the Great War Against Chaos, he immediately initiates sweeping reforms to end the corruption that previously brought the Empire to its knees, creating new laws to limit the nobility, cults, guilds and much more. He also oversees the foundation of many new institutions, including the formal creation of the Empire State Armies, Imperial Navy, and, controversially, the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, making magic legal across all the Empire for the first time. </p>\n<h3>2308-2310 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Third Parravon War</em>. The Bretonnian duchy of Parravon invades the Reikland across the Grey Lady Pass, claiming the military escalation in Ubersreik caused by the mustering of the new State Army breaks an ancient treaty. They are quickly driven back, and the following year Parravon is besieged. Eventually, after a year of occasional skirmishes outside Parravon’s extraordinarily high walls, and a great deal of standing around shouting insults, the King of Bretonnia treats on behalf of Parravon with Emperor Magnus I, ending the war.</p>\n<h3>2402-2405 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Fourth Parravon War</em>. The Bretonnian duchy of Parravon again invades the Reikland across the Grey Lady Pass. Ubersreik is besieged twice during the war, but doesn’t fall. Peace is eventually brokered by the intervention of Emperor Dieter IV who agrees to pay the Parravonese an extortionate sum of money to retreat, drawing much criticism at court.</p>\n<p>2415 IC</p>\n<p><em>The Night of a Thousand Arcane Duels</em>. War erupts between the Eight Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, razing large sections of the city and resulting in the death of six of the eight Patriarchs. The Cult of Sigmar pressures the Prince of Altdorf and Emperor Dieter IV to lock the Colleges down, which they do, resulting in the execution of many wizards, and effectively bringing legal magic use to an end in the Empire. Many of the surviving wizards flee the Colleges, never to return.</p>\n<h3>2420-2424 IC</h3>\n<p><em>WAAAGH! Grom!</em> The Goblin Warboss Grom the Paunch leads an enormous horde of Greenskins across the Empire, sacking many Reikland towns and villages, before eventually heading westwards, undefeated, where he then takes to the sea. The lack of wizards from the suspended Colleges of Magic is widely blamed for the repeated military defeats suffered by Reikland’s armies.</p>\n<h3>2429 IC</h3>\n<p>Westerland buys its independence from the Empire by bribing Emperor Dieter IV, reforming itself as The Wasteland with Marienburg as its capital. Using anti-corruption laws put in place by Magnus the Pious almost a hundred years earlier, the Elector Counts depose Dieter in the ensuing scandal. He is replaced by Grand Prince Wilhelm of House Holswig-Schliestein of the Reikland, who is named Emperor Wilhelm III, starting the imperial dynasty that rules the Empire to this day.</p>\n<p><em>The Battle for Grootscher Marsh</em>. Emperor Wilhelm III, under pressure from the Elector Counts to respond to the Wasteland’s secession from the Empire, gathers the State Armies to invade Marienburg. In late Autumn, the opposing forces meet at the Grootscher Marsh just outside Siert, and the Empire is routed by the advanced Marienburg navy, well-trained mercenaries and militias, and the magics of the Wasteland’s High Elven allies. Begrudgingly, Wilhelm verbally recognises the Wasteland’s independence, but refuses to ratify it with a treaty. Marienburg accepts this and draws their new border at Siert.</p>\n<h3>2430 IC</h3>\n<p>Appalled at the State Army’s inability to effectively counteract the Elven mages and Marienburg ships, Emperor Wilhelm III reinstates the Colleges of Magic after their 15-year suspension and invests significant resources into shipbuilding at the Reiksport.</p>\n<h3>2431 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Great Fire of Altdorf</em>. The newly reinstated Bright College accidentally sets Altdorf alight when a spell misfires, burning many buildings to the ground. Many lobby Emperor Wilhelm III hard to suspend the colleges again, but eventually he decides to keep them open, but with greater oversight from the Cult of Sigmar.</p>\n<h3>2453 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Fourth Siege of Altdorf</em>. The Liche King, Arkhan the Black, invades the Reikland with a seemingly endless swarm of walking corpses that march straight for Altdorf. Once the siege begins, Arkhan slips unnoticed into the High Temple of Sigmar and steals the dreaded Liber Mortis kept within. Minutes after he escapes, his army collapses, leaving thousands of carcasses mouldering outside the city walls as state soldiers look on in confusion and relief.</p>\n<h3>2480 IC</h3>\n<p>In Drachenfels Castle, Constant Drachenfels is slain by Crown Prince Oswald von Königswald of Ostland.</p>\n<h3>2483 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Luitpold III signs treaties with the Wasteland to allow warships of the Imperial Navy to pass through the city-port of Marienburg. For the first time since the secession of the Wasteland, the Reiklander navy is sailing the high seas, although the tolls to do so are extortionate.</p>\n<h3>2502 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Luitpold III dies in his sleep. In a close vote, Luitpold’s son is elected to replace him, and is crowned Emperor Karl-Franz I in the High Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf.</p>\n<h3>2505 IC</h3>\n<p>By imperial appointment, the playwright Detlef Seirk attempts to stage an ambitious play in Castle Drachenfels for Emperor Karl-Franz and the gathered nobility of the Empire. It goes disastrously wrong.</p>\n<h3>2508 IC</h3>\n<p>Malathrax the Mighty, an enormous Doomfire Dragon, terrorises the Vorbergland, razing villages and taking livestock, before its driven north across the Hägercrybs. After several months of pursuit, and the eradication of the entire Knightly Order of the Ebon Sword, the Dragon is slain by the Imperial Huntsmarshal, Markus Wulfhart, who places three arrows in its heart.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"96GBTjaS0YbDxpqo","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Reikland"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Reikland","sort":100001}}}

He is the brother of Taal and, according to Ulrican lore, the king of the gods, although other cults dispute this. He is normally portrayed as a massive, heavily bearded barbarian wearing a white wolf-pelt cloak, and bearing a mighty war-axe named Blitzbeil. He’s a distant, harsh, and unforgiving god who expects his cultists to rely on individual strength and prowess. He despises weakness, cowardice, and trickery, and favours the direct approach in all matters.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ulric’s cult is strongest in the north of the Empire. The city-state of Middenheim, with its enormous high temple to Ulric, is the heart of his cult, and the god is regarded as the city’s patron. Elsewhere, he is worshipped mainly by warriors and soldiers. Devout Ulricans can usually be spotted by their long hair and beards, for most choose not to cut it, imitating their wild deity. Ulric’s cult is split into just two orders: the priestly Howling Wolves, and the templar White Wolves. The Howling Wolves are not very popular outside Middenland and Nordland, viewed by most folk to be too coarse for this enlightened era. By comparison, the Knights of the White Wolf are enormously popular, easily the largest knightly order in the Empire, and the oldest templar order in the Old World. Ulric’s priests wear black robes with a howling white wolf emblem on the chest. A wolf pelt across the shoulders is also common, as is fur trimmings.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Ulric’s high temple is in Middenheim, and the cult’s leader, Ar-Ulric (which means the son of Ulric), has enormous temporal and spiritual sway. At the back of the high temple lies the Flame of Ulric, a huge, ever-burning, argent fire granted by the winter god to guide his people. This miracle is the focus of several pilgrimage routes, and all Ulricans of Middenland are expected to bathe in its cold light at least once in their lives. Smaller temples are found in every city and town of any size, but are grander and more numerous in the north than in the south. Chapels and shrines can be found in barracks and forts throughout the Old World.</p>\n<p>Temples resemble fortified keeps and are normally square. The interior of the main hall is lit by small windows high in the walls, and by an ever-stocked fire in a circular hearth tended by the priesthood. Behind the fire, usually against a rear wall, stands a statue of Ulric enthroned, often flanked by a pair of enormous wolves. Shrines are similar but smaller, with a lamp in place of a fire and small statues just a foot or two tall.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Ulric are almost always tests of strength, courage, and martial skill. Slaying a powerful monster, or clearing out a nest of Beastmen or outlaws, are typical tasks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Obey your betters.</em></li>\n<li><em>Defend your honour in all matters, and never refuse a challenge.</em></li>\n<li><em>Stand honest and true; outside an ambush, trickery and deception are forbidden.</em></li>\n<li><em>Only wear pelts from wolves killed by weapons crafted of your own hands.</em></li>\n<li><em>Blackpowder, helmets, crossbows, and technology are not Ulric’s way.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Blessing of Might}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.v28a5ilgxvDJfBqR]{Hoarfrost's Chill}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.9ALNZLZUZSLrLvkd]{Howl of the Wolf}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.3ONBOTaeWq657MQR]{Pelt of the Winter Wolf}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GVMPSJwgscMVJzpX]{The Snow King's Judgement}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.F6iJdTrvBvGQ54G3]{Ulric's Fury}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rrfrmqCpy10u7c9o]{Winter's Bite}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ulric.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":1100001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":1100001}}}
{"_id":"M8a3T91oq6cGCR7M","name":"Social Status and Standing","content":"<p>The rules regarding @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Status} are an incredible tool for building context and theme in your Campaigns. A Character’s Status often says more about their world than Class or Career, as it shapes their likely peers, living arrangements, and the logistics of their everyday lives. The following pages are set aside to expand those rules and give advice on how to use them.</p>\n<h3>Costs of Living</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5gvMwgLgn3fAW3VM]{The Cost of Living} states that a Character is expected to spend approximately half their Status and Standing every day to maintain appearances, and that even this exorbitant amount is considered ‘frugal living.’ </p>\n<p>Whilst this number seems potentially prohibitive for Brass and Silver Statuses, when it comes to Gold Status, it is outright extortionate! And yet, these numbers reflect a very real situation for transient people, such as Warhammer Characters.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it’s worth remembering that a Character doesn’t begin to lose Standing until they’ve spent a week living beneath their expected expenses. However, recovering Standing requires this spending every single day for a week to regain one point. It’s easier to maintain a facade than to build one.</p>\n<p>These systems are in place to create an urgency to adventure. The Characters are not typical examples of their Careers, but rather desperate and extraordinary. Their lives exist in a state of constant change that few in the Empire enjoy (or suffer) by virtue of being the focus of our attention at the table. This need to spend money constantly results in a need to earn money — a lot of money — frequently as well, meaning Characters are more likely to take risks, bet on the wrong Middenball team, involve themselves in shady business, and meet dramatic fates. That is one of the central tensions built into the Warhammer world, and one of your greatest tools to exploit when building adventures.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>A Character’s Standing is often in flux, and the folk of the Old World change their Standing often — by the whims of the Gods, the seasons, and through hard work. But changing one’s Status is rather perilous. It is a fundamental threat to the social order of the Empire. The growing middle class directly threatens the existence of the nobility, and in turn the place in the pecking order of favoured peasants. As such, few people look kindly on social climbers, and there is often a host of issues that comes along with increasing or decreasing one’s Status.</p>\n<p>As the GM, it’s your job to reinforce the central conflicts in the Warhammer world, and one of the starkest is the class struggle that underpins everything in the Empire. To reinforce this, consider not just how NPCs not of a Character’s current Status perceive them, but also those of their new and old Statuses after changing Careers. Old friends may now regard the Characters as out of touch or snobby, whilst new peers may see them as uppity or possibly admirable — having ‘pulled themselves up by their bootstraps’. Characters who drop Status may find themselves surrounded by people who consider the Character ‘too big for their britches’, and other such derogatory phrases.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the Empire, despite how it might seem, is steadfastly not a meritocracy — that is, the best person for the job isn’t always, or even often, the one who fills it. Privilege is everywhere in the Empire, and no one gets to high places alone. Consider who around the Characters may resent them for their rise (small as it may be), or who see them as their own ticket up the social ladder. Use these class struggles as an opportunity for the world to change around the Characters, and in turn for the Character to change their world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Options: Transitional Status</span></h3>\n<p><em>Changing Status and Standing in the Old World is more difficult than merely finding a new job. To reflect this, you might have achieving new Status and Standing be a gradual process, counting a Career’s stated Status and Standing as its upper limit, rather than its new default.</em></p>\n<p><em>When a Character changes Careers, the Status and Standing of their new Career is their upper limit, rather than their new default, with their current Status and Standing remaining where it was. Characters must act according to the rules laid out in @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Keeping Up Appearances} to raise their Status to its new maximum.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Tapping Communities</h3>\n<p>A Character’s peers are often the first place they’ll want to go to find out information about their current Adventures, future opportunities, or just general gossip. As such, it’s a good idea to create a small cast of NPCs in any locale that the Characters will spend their time in who reflect the attitude and temperaments of the three Statuses. These NPCs can act as the mouth-pieces of their communities, as well as key contacts for the Characters as they inhabit those spaces. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, if a locale includes members of certain restricted classes — represented through the Etiquette Talent — they should have their own NPC. Consider how these NPCs may overlap: perhaps a village has three NPCs of each Status, and two Criminal NPCs, one Brass and one Gold. What does this say about the nature of crime in the community? What does this mean for the Characters moving through it?</p>\n<p>Encourage your Players to have their Characters consort primarily with their own communities, and then come together to share that knowledge. Each community will have different things they know about, care about, and can act on. Gold NPCs may be able to manipulate the courts or local State Army, whilst Servant communities likely have more personal noble gossip — because they spend so much time with nobles, who barely notice that they exist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>‘We Don’t Serve Your Kind’</em></h3>\n<p><em>Whilst upper class types might think they rule the Old World, the realities of the Empire’s cities and towns is far different. It’s certainly true that a Brass Status individual would have a hard time getting into a palace, a Gold Status patron might find themselves uncomfortable in a seedy docker’s pub.</em></p>\n<p><em>In this way, places and situations can have a Status as well, and even have an @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Social Group attached to them, though these are only reserved for special scenes. When present, any NPCs who match the location’s Status count as being subject to a @JournalEntry[4cRhTRnXFqMf90Bs]{Psychology} against non-members.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the space includes an Etiquette that the Character lacks, count their Status as one step removed, in either direction, for the purposes of the above. If this would make a Status three steps removed (e.g. a Gold Status Character moving into a Brass Status space with the Criminal Etiquette), then the occupants of that space gain Hatred instead.</em></p>\n<p><em>Characters who comport themselves well, and strive to fit into the new crowd, may eventually develop a reputation with a specific space, and forgo these penalties, but this is rare and unlikely. Additionally, if members of the Character’s Status discover these transgressions, there may be negative effects within one’s own community.</em></p>\n<p><em>Also note that people of lower Status are unlikely to publicly attack people of higher Status, as this brings with it a lot of dangerous complications. So whilst a Gold Status Character moving into a Brass Status space with the Criminal Etiquette might find themselves getting murderous glances, they’re unlikely to get hurt when eyes are on them… however, as soon as they step outside into the alley, things might be very different, indeed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<table style=\"height:68px;width:669px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:35px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">Brass</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">Gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:35px;text-align:center\">Brass</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">-</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GwjvDLZz3PvK6xgs]{Prejudice}</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.0VpT5yubw4UL7j6f]{Animosity}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:35px;text-align:center\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GwjvDLZz3PvK6xgs]{Prejudice}</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">-</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GwjvDLZz3PvK6xgs]{Prejudice}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:35px;text-align:center\">Gold</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.0VpT5yubw4UL7j6f]{Animosity}</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GwjvDLZz3PvK6xgs]{Prejudice}</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:207px;text-align:center\">-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":600001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":600001}}}

Most travelers through the region prefer the relative safety of river travel to journeying along uncertain roads, and with good reason; the Reikwald is a favoured haunt of outcasts, cut-throats, and other lawless folk. While all major routes are patrolled by road warden, their numbers are too few and the roads too long, so it’s not uncommon to encounter upturned coaches and other signs of banditry. Te majority of the open clearings and abandoned ruins from past wars are claimed as camps by outlaws or by one of the herds of Beastmen roaming the deeper wood, and forays to clear these isolated places by regiments of the Reikland State Army are not uncommon. In most parts the Reikwald’s canopy is not so overgrown as to block sunlight, but its depths are frequently gloomy and heavy fogs are common, especially along the marshier stretches of the @JournalEntry[The Reik]{river Reik}. Scholars claim before the Empire was founded the Unberogen tribe of Humans ranged across this misty forest alongside older tribes whose names are now lost to memory. Concentric rings of carved standing stones called ‘oghams’ still exist from this era, though many are overgrown and almost impossible to find without a guide. Isolated communities still following ancient ways — old beliefs said to predate the coming of Sigmar — are said to hold such sites sacred. Intellectuals from the Colleges of Magic postulate terrible battles were once fought for these ancient, megalithic sites, and it’s not uncommon to find richer magisters funding explorations into the Reikwald’s depths to learn more about the magical stones.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fake It 'Til You Make It Out Alive!</strong>: Highway robbery is good business, but now Mathilde Schlitz wants out.

This so charmed Shallya that the goddess fell in love. One fateful day, she found Ranald dying, fatally touched by the plagues of the Fly Lord. Unable to accept this, she let Ranald drink from her holy chalice, granting the rogue eternal life. But it was all a trick — Ranald had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced into the heavens. While generally portrayed as a dapper Human wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height, weight, skin colour, or even gender of Ranald, though the god is more commonly portrayed as male in the Empire. More a cheerful trickster than outright criminal, Ranald is said to have a love of deflating pride with clever tricks and ruses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald most commonly stands as a patron to thieves and rogues, but the cult also attracts gamblers, liars, merchants, tricksters, and the poor and downtrodden.</p>\n<p>The cult of Ranald is, by general perception, a disorganised rabble of charlatans, thieves, and ne’er-do-wells. However, it is more co-ordinated than it appears, and split into three primary orders. The Crosses are the most accepted — a priesthood overseeing the cult’s gambling-dens, typically using the proceeds to administer to the poor. The Brotherhood is less open, and is somewhat akin to a secret society of merchants — they use business to bring the pompous and greedy to their knees. Lastly, and most widespread, is the publicly disavowed Crooked Fingers, the thieves, rogues, and liars of Ranald, a group that is roundly distrusted.</p>\n<p>Cultists of Ranald have no conventional garb to identify them, but always work cross symbols into their clothing somewhere, perhaps as a repeating pattern.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald has no formal temple organisation, although the cult maintains seemingly unconnected gambling dens in most towns and cities. Small shrines are found in the headquarters of many criminal gangs and merchant houses, and the poorer quarters of many cities have street-corner shrines dedicated to the God of Luck. The latter are often maintained by local ‘shrine clubs’ which operate as both social and religious bodies, and are usually led by one of the Crooked Fingers. Shrines are almost never elaborate, often just a simple, smiling statue with crossed fingers behind the back, or a crudely depicted cat or magpie, often fashioned as if smiling.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald’s penances usually involve stealing into locked and guarded locations to recover precious items or leave a token of their presence. Humiliating oppressors of the poor is also common — perhaps by framing a brutal Watch captain for a ludicrous crime, for example, or locking him in his own cells. Ranald often sends favoured and disfavoured cultists alike on a ‘Pilgrimage of Fingers’, a set of tasks proving capability and loyalty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>One coin in ten belongs to Ranald.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never betray another to the authorities; there is no greater sin than informing.</em></li>\n<li><em>Violence is prohibited except in self-defence.</em></li>\n<li><em>It is better to live free and die than live under oppression.</em></li>\n<li><em>There is no honour among thieves, but there is amongst Ranaldans.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FElNQGNiPzaOwwKT]{Blessing of Charisma}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.OkKWAfnMiHfxhTnB]{Blessing of Finesse}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tMocig1z9dHKNiCT]{Blessing of Wit}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.1MUSq1xRyHCaIuAL]{An Invitation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Bo3ukcaipFNb7Ljl]{Cat's Eyes}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.hL7B3d7A0sYYjHXn]{Ranald's Grace}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.QSwJNH8sotKjtdi4]{Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FfGboPdR54WHtkAE]{Stay Lucky}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.fABd17NZvg2uUReL]{You Ain’t Seen Me, Right?}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ranald.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":600001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":600001}}}

{"_id":"PlOCivLBxMxUlqiq","name":"Taking Your Turn","content":"<p>Combat is a dynamic, disorientating experience, with friend and foe desperately weaving around each other, blades flashing as thrust follows parry follows gunshot. </p>\n<p>The GM describes the situation — where everyone is, what your surroundings are like — and you can ask for more details to flesh things out and help plan your action. ‘How thick is the chandelier rope? Could an arrow cut it?’, for example. When it’s your Turn, you’ll make your Move and take Action! </p>\n<p>On your Turn you have a Move and an Action, you can take these in any order — it’s presumed you are probably doing both at the same time, and you can freely describe them as one combined manoeuvre. You can also skip taking an Action or Move, though you won’t get another opportunity until the next Round!</p>\n<p>Vivid descriptions of what you do will bring the Combat to life. Rather than declare your action is, ‘hit the Goblin’, it’s much more fun to say, ‘I Kick the chair in front of me towards the Goblins and lunge with my sword at the closest one’s throat’. You never know, the GM might reward you with the odd bonus for great roleplaying. This goes for the resolution of your Action too — the GM will describe the outcome, but you can certainly embellish it! </p>\n<h4>Move</h4>\n<p>In most circumstances, exact distances don’t matter too much. Use your Movement Characteristic as a guide to the ground you can cover, and the GM will let you know if the move will take more than one Turn. Reaching difficult places, perhaps by climbing or jumping, will also use your Action if you need to Test a Skill to get there (perhaps with a Climb or Athletics Test).</p>\n<p>If you are not already fighting someone, you can also use your Move to Charge into close combat, gaining +1 Advantage. For more on this, and for a detailed breakdown of movement speeds, leaping distances, and more, see @JournalEntry[efIMLdnXk5Y7leLu]{Moving During Combat}.</p>\n<h4>Action</h4>\n<p>In combat, your Action is used to do something. Whether that’s swing a sword at a Mutant, jump from rooftop to rooftop, or take a moment to gauge the situation, that’s up to you. Your Action is only limited by your imagination, the physical constraints of the fight location and the capabilities of your Character.</p>\n<p>Describe what you want your Character to do. The GM will then tell you if you need to make a Test to succeed at your planned Action. The results will then be narrated by you and the GM, ending your Action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><strong>Example</strong>: </span>Molli looks on nervously from behind a barrel as Salundra is beset by the flying fists of three pub brawlers keen to put the young captain in her place. On her Turn, Molli’s player asks if the pub has an upper floor. The GM confirms it does, and that it has a balcony overlooking the fight. Smiling, the player declares Molli will sprint upstairs and push a table down on the fight to help break it up using both her Move and Action. Given the upper floor isn’t far away, the GM decides Molli can get there in a single Round but pushing the small table there will take a little effort.</p>\n<p>The GM calls for an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to heft the table over the balcony. Molli’s Athletics is 34, so she needs to roll 54 or under. She rolls 21, for +3 SL, and the table flies! Molli shouts out as the table tips: ‘Stop fighting!’ The GM states all combatants below must perform an <strong>Opposed Dodge</strong> Test against the +3 SL or be hit by the table. Unfortunately, only Salundra fails this, and the table lands squarely on her head…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Free Actions</h4>\n<p>Some things you’ll want your Character to do won’t count as your Action for the round — such as shouting a warning,  drawing your weapon, or drinking a potion. It’s the GM’s decision on what takes up your Action, and what you can do in a Round.

{"_id":"RoNPATyfG4PHQBZa","name":"The Aethyr","content":"<p>Magical abilities mark you as a figure of terror and awe in the Empire. Prior to the establishment of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, those able to wield magic were reviled outlaws. Nowadays being a witch is not illegal, but casting magic without a licence is. Spellcasters within the Empire must either study at the Colleges of Magic, refrain from casting spells, or hope no-one notices their illicit activity. Even licenced wizards are generally feared and avoided — legal status has done nothing to reduce the superstitious dread of the common folk.</p>\n<p>Magic is seen as unnatural and is notorious for its darker elements: the crippling hexes of witchcraft, the raising of the dead, and the summoning of Daemonic entities. Even when practiced according to the teaching of the Colleges, magic can be the cause of trouble. The very source of magic is unstable, and even the most experienced spellcaster can lose focus, resulting in dangerous accidents and unexpected side-effects.</p>\n<h2>THE AETHYR</h2>\n<p>Scholars of magic derive their learning from the Elves, who explained the source of all magical power is the Aethyr. This infinite dimension, said to be the spawning ground of daemons and spirits, exists beyond the physical world. The Elves taught that far to the north of the Empire, a great ragged wound was torn through the fabric of the world to the Aethyr, and it bleeds raw magic. These roiling energies — known as the Winds of Magic — blow throughout the world, gathering and eddying in great heavenly whorls, only to rain down and permeate the land and the creatures dwelling upon it. It is these powerful winds that wizards and witches use to fuel their spells.</p>\n<h3>The Winds Of Magic</h3>\n<p>As magical power bursts into the mortal realm and sweeps down from the north, it splinters and separates, like light splitting through a prism. The Colleges of Magic state this creates eight discrete Winds referred to by colour, each with its own character and strengths. The Elves support this, teaching the same eight winds to their apprentices before moving on to more powerful magics.</p>\n<p>Only a small minority of Humans can perceive the Winds, and even fewer can bend them to their will. Most Elves are sensitive to them, and many possess the ability to see the Winds clearly — commonly known as Second Sight, or just the Sight — with many also able to learn how to cast magic. Dwarfs disdain magic, perhaps because they are partially immune to it, and no Dwarf wizards are known. Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic: except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles.</p>\n<p>The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic. They argued that while it is possible to cast spells by drawing from multiple winds, doing so is a risky proposition for the feeble, corruptible Human mind. This wisdom has been adopted by the Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour. </p>\n<p>Some witches outside the College system consider these restrictions ludicrous, an attempt by the Elves to keep the most powerful magics to themselves. Drawing on multiple winds is a quick route to power, but also to damnation. Many an unlicensed witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters. </p>\n<p>Others believe magical energies are not so easily categorised. Many different types of ‘wizard’ and ‘witch’ can be found throughout the Old World, with some practicing magic that seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst some of the other species besetting the Empire, such as the Greenskins.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>What Is The Aethyr?</em></h3>\n<p><em>There is much heated debate between ‘experts’ on the nature of magic. The lecture halls of the Empire’s most learned institutions often see ambitious scholars expound on their latest theories. Some liken magic to the backstage of a theatre, a mass of mechanisms, props, and hidden pulleys responsible for the drama viewed by the audience. Others resort to mathematical metaphors, complete with incomprehensible esoteric diagrams. Although such may end with an air of confident finality, it will only be met with polite coughs, raised hands, and a litany of objections and exceptions.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Language of Magic</h3>\n<p>The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of Magick. For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds are uttered by those attuned to magic, the Winds answer. The Colleges of Magic teach a complex language called the lingua praestantia which form the basis of their spells, originally taught to Humanity by the Elves. Although extraordinarily difficult to correctly annunciate, it is a significant simplification of the Elven tongue Anoqeyån , the language used by the Elves to shape their own, more powerful magics. Wizards of the Colleges and the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of Magick. Its complex forms are also spoken by many magical creatures found across the Old World, including Spirits and Daemons. Many witches seem to instinctively understand the language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging to be spoken as a spell.</p>\n<h3>The Eight Lores</h3>\n<p>Each of the eight Winds of Magic has an associated Lore, a body of spells and knowledge its adepts use. Each of the eight Colleges of Magic is dedicated to the study of a single Lore, and their buildings are constructed to focus their Wind to facilitate relatively safe tuition. </p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[X6qhaU9mesSLjk0w]{The Lore of Light}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[btmw3WI2twBw7LmR]{The Lore of Metal}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[rbfM7InGHoJoiZBy]{The Lore of Life}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[eZWLEgOLSXUUuBEl]{The Lore of Heavens}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[QSQgs7mj3Kru82Yw]{The Lore of Shadows}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[NYgZFfxWQ1BldMni]{The Lore of Death}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[h36SjjE3TnCQC3ow]{The Lore of Fire}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Hq0PrEh4AcTO2DZ3]{The Lore of Beasts}</p>\n<h3>Elven Magic</h3>\n<p>Elves are long lived beings whose minds are more attuned to the workings of magic than those of humanity. High Elven mages usually train in several, sometimes all, of the eight winds as part of their apprenticeships, before the most promising move on to study High Magic: Qhaysh . This is the blending of multiple winds of magic together into a blinding, coruscating energy. This magic is impressive and difficult, and Elves claim it is beyond the capacity of humankind. </p>\n<p>The Wood Elves, too, make use of the eight Winds of Magic, though their Spellsingers usually focus upon the Jade and Amber Winds. The most powerful usually go on to study either High Magic like High Elves, or dread Dark Magic – a foul mixing of the eight winds that can create tremendously destructive effects.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>While difficult to master Qhaysh is the safe blending of multiple Winds of Magic, Dhar , known commonly as Dark Magic, is much more dangerous method of casting spells using multiple winds. It is usually only practiced by evil sorcerers, Necromancers, and powerful witches, offering them a seductive source of raw power, yet one laced with terrible side-effects. Few can channel Dhar for long, without succumbing to the corrupting influence of the malevolent wind, their bodies and minds being warped into unnatural states. </p>\n<p>Dhar resembles a stagnant mire to those with the Sight, pooling in places saturated with evil, or corruption: the herdstones of Beastmen, the dark idols of chaos cultists, and places where great workings of several of the Winds of Magic took place. Dhar is so dense and potent that it can independently coalesce or crystalize into physical matter, eventually forming the widely feared substance called warpstone.</p>\n<h4>Warpstone</h4>\n<p>Warpstone is a lump of pure magic in the material plane. Its unnatural provenance is immediately obvious to all who see it, as it hurts the eyes and mutates anything drawing close for too long. Although its form varies, it often holds hard facets like flint, and radiates a queasy green glow.</p>\n<p>Close examination of the substance is not to be undertaken lightly. Warpstone is the stuff of Chaos made manifest and its presence is deeply corrupting. Those who have direct contact with warpstone risk illness, madness and mutation, and anyone who ingests so much as a pinch of the stuff dooms themselves to catastrophic warping of body and mind. Nonetheless, the world is full of reckless, ambitious fools who know that the volatile and dangerous substance is a tremendous source of energy for spells and rituals.</p>\n<p>The followers of Chaos and the Skaven do not hesitate to use it. To them, warpstone is a literal gift from the gods to be valued above gold and jewels, and to be used against their enemies.</p>\n<h3>Other Lores</h3>\n<p>In less frequented corners of the Empire, in villages and rural communities far from the influence of the Colleges of Magic, older forms of magic are still practiced even though they are outlawed and punishable by death. There are uncounted varieties of these, but two of the more common Lores still practised by Humans are Hedgecraft and Witchcraft.</p>\n<h4>The Lore of Hedgecraft</h4>\n<p>Practitioners of Hedgecraft generally live quiet lives on the fringes of smaller human settlements, in service to local communities. Just as they live their lives in the ‘hedge’ between civilisation and the wilds of nature, so much of their magic concerns itself with the liminal space between the material world and the realm of the spirits.  Their magic tends to focus on folklore, spirits and the natural world, as well as means to aid the rural communities which shelter them. Once a relatively common sight in the Empire, over two centuries of persecution since the founding of the Colleges of Magic has all but wiped them out. </p>\n<h4>The Lore of Witchcraft</h4>\n<p>While the Lore of Witchcraft is not inherently malicious, or tied to the gods of Chaos, it has a justly earned reputation for evil and unpleasantness. Often self-taught and using multiple Winds of Magic, those practising the Lore of Witchcraft lack the discipline or knowledge of College wizards and are at a significant risk of corruption. The combination of the corrosive effects of Dhar and being shunned by right-minded folk of the Empire often makes these Witches bitter, spiteful souls, their hearts hard and flinty, their gaze baleful and ill-omened.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/winds.webp","folder":"yk4Dt6l9wHqAgS46","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Magic"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Magic","sort":200001}}}
{"_id":"Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79","name":"Injury","content":"<p>2Almost all characters will suffer injuries during the course of play. The injury rules show you how to deal with them and how to heal them, when possible.</p>\n<h3><strong>Wounds, Critical Wounds, and Death</strong></h3>\n<p>Wound loss represents minor cuts and abrasions, bruises and bashes, and even the depletion of spiritual and mental energy reserves. By comparison, Critical Wounds are much more severe, expressing serious injuries, broken bones, torn muscles, and ripped flesh. Gain too many Critical Wounds, and you risk death.</p>\n<h4><strong>Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>Wounds are lost by sustaining Damage. Each time you suffer a point of Damage, you lose 1 Wound. So, if you suffer 8 points of Damage, you lose 8 Wounds. Often, especially in combat, your Toughness Bonus or Armour Points may reduce suffered Damage. </p>\n<p>So, if you were hit in the arm for 10 Damage and your Toughness Bonus was 3, and you had leather armour on that arm for 1 Armour Point, you would suffer 6 Wounds (10–3–1=6). The rules will tell you when you can or cannot reduce Damage with Toughness and Armour Points. </p>\n<p>If you lose all of your Wounds, your collected injuries overwhelm you, and you gain the Prone Condition. Until you heal at least 1 Wound, you cannot lose the Prone Condition; worse, if you’re not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus, you will pass out, gaining the Unconscious Condition. You will not regain consciousness until you heal back at least 1 Wound (see @JournalEntry[go7JJA0AzyQ08Kew]{Healing}).</p>\n<p>If you take enough Damage that you would be taken to negative Wounds — say you suffered 5 Damage when you only had 2 Wounds left — you suffer a Critical Wound. If you suffer fewer negative Wounds than your Toughness Bonus (so, fewer than –4 Wounds if your Toughness Bonus is 4), you subtract –20 from your Critical Table result, with a minimum result of 01. Note: You never actually go into negative Wounds. The lowest number of Wounds you can ever have is 0.</p>\n<h4><strong>Critical Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>Critical Wounds are most commonly suffered in combat when something really wants to hurt you. The two most frequent sources of Critical Wounds are when a Critical Hit is scored, or when you lose more Wounds than you have (see @JournalEntry[zUG2L9VchlHWYTeM]{Combat} for more on how Critical Hits happens). </p>\n<p>Each Critical Wound you receive will impact your ability to function in a different way. To determine what effects a Critical Wound has, refer to the Critical Tables.</p>\n<h4><strong>Death</strong></h4>\n<p>If you take the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition and have 0 Wounds, compare the total number of Critical Wounds you currently suffer with your Toughness Bonus. If you have more Critical Wounds than your Toughness Bonus, you succumb to your horrific wounds and will die at the end of the round unless, by some miracle, someone heals one of your Critical Wounds. </p>\n<p>Also, if you have the Unconscious Condition, anyone attacking you with suitable weapons can kill you, should they wish. </p>\n<p>Though, in the thick of combat, those lying apparently dead on the floor are almost always ignored in favour of combatants still standing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few results sourced from the Critical Tables can result in death. Should any of these occur, it is time to permanently spend a @JournalEntry[01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl]{Fate point} if you have one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Pulling Your Blows</h3>\n<p>The rules assume you wish to inflict every possible Critical Wound you can. However, it’s also possible you may just want to subdue, not kill, your opponents. Or you may be sparring. With that in mind, you may ignore any Critical Hit you should inflict upon your opponents if you declare you are ‘pulling your blow’ before you roll to hit.

{"_id":"VRFxm5Aif3ZrRcZe","name":"Advantage (GM's Guide)","content":"<h3>Advantage In Large Combats</h3>\n<p>The Advantage system works well when there are only a handful of combatants, but it quickly becomes unmanageable when there are ten or more Characters and Creatures all fighting together. In such situations, here are two approaches that work well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert multiple Creatures into a Swarm. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.E2Es82TvBKa7CoDG]{Swarm} rules are purposefully vague enough that they can be applied to any group of combatants, whether they are actually swarming creatures like rats, or just a rabble of peasants. Two Swarms of Clanrats backed up by a single Rat Ogre is a much more manageable encounter than managing 20 Clanrats individually.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Use Group Advantage. When there are multiple combatants working together as a group, you may abstract their Advantage into one single pool of Advantage that they all use. When you do this, generate Advantage as normal, but with a limit of Initiative Bonus gained per Round of combat, regardless of the source. Additionally, whenever a member of the group would lose all of their Advantage, the group loses 2 instead, keeping the remainder.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: The Characters are fighting six Goblins, and the GM decides to use Group Advantage. The Goblins have an Initiative Bonus of 2, so can generate a maximum of 2 Advantage as a group per Round. On the first Round, three of the Goblins charge the Characters. Normally, each would generate 1 Advantage, but instead, they generate 3 Advantage for the group, which drops down to 2 given their Initiative Bonus. Any additional Advantage gained this Round by any of the Goblins won’t be counted, but now they all benefit from a +20 to all relevant Tests. On the following Round, after gaining +2 more Advantage as a group, one of the Goblins is defeated in an Opposed Melee Test. Normally that Goblin would lose all of their Advantage, but because they are in a group, the group merely loses 2 Advantage, and retains the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Removing Advantage</h3>\n<p>Whilst it’s great when you have Advantage on your side, the tables can turn very quickly in WFRP, and before you know it, your opponents have built up deadly momentum. When overwhelming Advantage is accrued, it can seem impossible to overcome it. Here are three broad tips for removing Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Ranged Combatants</h4>\n<p>Ranged attacks cannot be Opposed unless performed at Point Blank Range or the target wields a shield, which means that no amount of Advantage will help a Character avoid losing Wounds! Make sure to place a few Creatures with ranged attacks in Combat scenes, and have them target the Characters who are building momentum the most. However, keep in mind that because ranged attacks aren’t Opposed, successfully hitting an opponent with a ranged attack doesn’t generate Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Passive Damage</h4>\n<p>Passive Damage is any source of Wound loss that isn’t defended against, such as from the Ablaze, Bleeding, or Poisoned Conditions. Whilst some of these Conditions would involve Tests where Advantage would be relevant (such as dodging a thrown Incendiary, or parrying a poisoned blade) there are other ways to inflict these Conditions: employ the terrain, use Long Range, or target a Character’s non-combat Skills, such as Endurance.</p>\n<h4>Retreat</h4>\n<p>Remember that a combatant loses 1 Advantage per Round if they failed to accrue any extra Advantage during that Round, or they end the Round outnumbered. Which means, if things are going badly for a combatant, they should try to put distance between themselves and their potential killer. Fleeing is one option, but it’s not the only one. Consider the location where the Combat is taking place, and see if there are any ways to create barriers between combatants — throwing tables and chairs in the way, setting the ground on fire, and cutting the ropes suspending a bridge, are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>With a bit of creativity, and by thinking about the Scene where the Combat takes place, you and your Players can use Advantage as an inspiring feature of the system, rather than a snowballing problem to overcome. Remember that, whilst the Characters in the story wouldn’t call it Advantage, they would be aware of momentum in a fight, and would try to be creative on the battlefield themselves to mitigate bad odds.</p>\n<h3>Creatures Without the Weapon Trait</h3>\n<p>Some Creatures such as the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.FmEDHnfAe2iIugpt]{Bog Octopus} in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay or the <em>Young Stirpike</em> in <strong>Ubersreik Adventures: If Looks Could Kill</strong> lack a Weapon Creature Trait, but have in its place the Bite, Tail, Tentacles, Vomit, and other such Traits that use Advantage as a cost. These Traits, without the Weapon Trait, mean that the Creature can’t perform normal attacks, and must use their special attacks if they want to defeat an opponent. </p>\n<p>This is entirely intentional, and allows these Creatures to be played in truly unorthodox ways, which encourages more dynamic Combat. You should consider the full range of methods for gaining @JournalEntry[sAFW2R7LeDYN5Z5F]{Advantage} to aid in these situations. Charging, for example, is a good tactic to use when immediately followed by a Bite. Also remember that larger Creatures do not need to Disengage, so they may Charge, Bite, and move away freely.</p>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":200001}}}

{"_id":"XUxruxa3RZeZVceD","name":"Bringing Your Character To Life","content":"<p>Fleshing out your Character’s personality and history will really help you bring them to life. Some players write detailed backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar with the Old World. Others prefer to just decide the basics at the start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the GM beforehand so you don’t derail any storylines). At the start of the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want to create, and we revisited that while creating Party ambitions. This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your Characters’ stories together and binding them into a tight-knit group with their own reasons for sticking together.</p>\n<h3>Ten Questions</h3>\n<p>One useful technique for creating an interesting background for your Character is to answer a series of questions about them — here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change something about the character you’ve created so far... do so! For instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may want to revisit the choices you made in @JournalEntry[sBmYOLfNwyT8lnwA]{4) Skills and Talents}. </p>\n<h4>Where are you from?</h4>\n<p>Do you come from one of Reikland’s bustling towns, or a sleepy village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead, or maybe you called the winding back alleys of Altdorf home? Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent threading the roads and riverways of Reikland, always on the move? </p>\n<h4>What is your family like?</h4>\n<p>It may take a village to raise a child, but it’s your kin who do the heavy lifting. What were your parents’ occupations? Are they still alive? Do you have any siblings? Were you close, or were you constantly at one another’s throats? Grandparents? Nephews, nieces, cousins? Children, even? Does your family approve of your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on your family’s honour? </p>\n<h4>What was your childhood like?</h4>\n<p>Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself? Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member, a village school, or the local priest? Were you trained in the family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere or raised in an orphanage? </p>\n<h4>Why did you leave home?</h4>\n<p>Do you still live in your childhood home, or did you leave? If so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose in your life?</p>\n<h4>Who are your best friends?</h4>\n<p>While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another matter entirely, and you can tell a lot about someone by the friends they keep. Do you have any friends from childhood? Or friends you’ve made since leaving home? What do you do together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour of a loyal pet? </p>\n<h4>What is your greatest desire?</h4>\n<p>What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal. If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be? </p>\n<h4>What are your best and worst memories?</h4>\n<p>We are the sum of our experiences; they shape and mould us, forging us anew. What are your most treasured memories? An afternoon of glorious summer sunshine? A passionate kiss, while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred, disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?</p>\n<h4>What are your religious beliefs?</h4>\n<p>Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration is a matter of course. That being said, not all of the gods are favoured equally. </p>\n<p>Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle? See Chapter 7: Religion and Belief for details of the gods and their ways. </p>\n<h4>To whom, or what, are you loyal?</h4>\n<p>Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire… or just to yourself? </p>\n<h4>Why are you adventuring?</h4>\n<p>And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not just another citizen of the Empire. Why are you adventuring?</p>\n<p>Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life thrust upon you, against your will. Are you seeking justice, or vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight to clear your name, or survive your enemies?</p>\n<p>Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character, ready to go. But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus XP during the character creation process? If so, you may wish to spend it before you begin play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Options: Psychology</h3>\n<p>When you are creating your Character’s story, you might feel you should have powerful emotions such as Love, Camaraderie, Hatred etc towards family members, situations, enemies or other features of their life. If the GM agrees, you can take a Psychology trait.</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"hflpTOpbTqmvqIxi","sort":125001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Character","sort":125001}}}

That’s not to say you can’t rise from humble origins, just that you’ve got a long journey ahead, and that you’ll probably need a better pair of boots. </p>\n<p>All the information describing your Character’s abilities is recorded on a Character Sheet. We provide ready-made Characters and sheets in the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>, and online at cubicle7.co.uk. Using ready-made Characters is a great way to start playing and find out how the game works, but sooner or later you’ll want to create your own from the ground up.</p>\n<p>When deciding what your Character will be like, discuss the kind of group you want to create with the other players. This makes sure that the group’s Characters complement each other and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of abilities. Your GM may also have a particular kind of game in mind, and you’ll need to make sure you have the right mix of Characters. Perhaps the GM plans for you to join a group of apprentice wizards who know one another at the Colleges of Magic? Maybe you are part of a unit of soldiers who have all deserted? Or maybe you are one of a disparate band of Reiklanders press-ganged into service by a powerful noble? Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character which will be more fun to play.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Character</h3>\n<p>In some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the result of a dice roll to make the choice for you. You may receive bonus Experience Points (XP) for choosing to accept random outcomes, as if the Dark Gods of Chaos themselves applaud your acceptance of random chance. XP represent learning from experience and are the principal way to improve your abilities — you will be able to spend these points to enhance your character’s abilities. XP are covered in more detail in @JournalEntry[FX9rb0LL6BStC7T8]{Career Advancement}. </p>\n<h2>Species</h2>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Choose one of the five Species</em>.</p>\n<p>Your Character will be a Human, Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, or Wood Elf. They are described below to help you choose, where you will also find some typical opinions each species has of the others. Alternatively, you can roll 1d100, consult the @Table[species]{Random Species Table}, and gain +20 XP if you accept the result.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[9JfYud9wQYoo8J4d]{Humans (Reiklander)}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2jOnMEHS9Xt26AQ7]{Dwarfs}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[rbYdtt30R3CXeDJI]{Halflings}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[AyYqr3arhId1F2F2]{High Elves}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[EbwOpdSrBetwXypd]{Wood Elves}</p>\n<h2>Steps</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[qiN0uSuMBBPqpc64]{Class And Career}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[fayg5SA1zaVnQKoH]{Attributes}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[sBmYOLfNwyT8lnwA]{Skills and Talents}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[lunUs6Mb1S7T3ZkY]{Trappings}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[y5TQUTaM03CTzmlD]{Adding Detail}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[KhO4Hy7ODHwUJ52z]{Party}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[XUxruxa3RZeZVceD]{Bringing Your Character To Life}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[FX9rb0LL6BStC7T8]{Advancement}</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"hflpTOpbTqmvqIxi","sort":1,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Character","sort":1}}}
{"_id":"dVOYsI5bAgCOi2M0","name":"The GM's Goals & Principles","content":"<p>Whilst it’s one thing to know how to GM the systems of WFRP, it’s another thing entirely to know how to GM the world. To help with this vital part of roleplaying, we’ve outlined goals to follow, and a set of principles to help you choose between multiple courses of action. </p>\n<p>The goals and principles are used in similar ways by many roleplaying games to help GMs answer the question ‘<em>What should happen next?</em>’ These tools are designed to help novice-to-experienced GMs align themselves with <strong>WFRP</strong>, and to think critically about the kind of experience they want their Players to have. </p>\n<p>These tools are not prescriptive. If you don’t follow them, you’re not playing the game ‘wrong’. But we encourage you to be open to trying them out — you may find they suit your group well!</p>\n<p>Lastly, this section details the thematic pillars that hold up Warhammer, and give some guidance on how to accentuate and focus on individual themes over the course of your campaigns.</p>\n<h2>The GM's Goal</h2>\n<p>The following list explains your goal as the GM, beyond that laid out in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. These four points should tell you what you’re trying to do, and why. Everything you do as a GM should serve these four goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the Old World come to life</li>\n<li>Create gripping and action-packed scenarios</li>\n<li>Build a story together</li>\n<li>Understand the Characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Make the Old World Come to Life</h3>\n<p>You’re there to make the Old World feel real, filled with believable people and places. But the Old World is a weird and often impossible place — with Beastmen, magic, mutation, and Chaos — so your job is to ground that in reality. What does it mean to have Second Sight? What is it really like to face a horde of ravening Greenskins?</p>\n<h3>Create Gripping and Action-Packed Scenarios</h3>\n<p>As a GM you’re there to inject drama and conflict into the lives of the Characters. You’re there to place walls between them and their Ambitions, and to tempt their Motivations with rewards. But Warhammer thrives on the mundane, juxtaposed with the epic. You’re there to make injury and illness exciting, to make the quest to afford one more meal, or a roof over one’s head, worthwhile.</p>\n<h3>Build A Story Together</h3>\n<p>You’re there to facilitate group storytelling. You’re there to share the spotlight, as evenly as possible, so everyone at the table has the opportunity to contribute. You’re not there to script the outcome of any action, but to interpret your Adventure, and the actions of your Characters.</p>\n<h3>Understand the Characters</h3>\n<p>You’re there to discover how the Characters are going to get through the challenges you give them. You’re there to be surprised and entertained, just like the other Players are! Don’t bother writing Adventures with balance or solutions in mind — in fact, throw your own solutions out the window. Present problems, and let your Players solve them creatively.</p>\n<h2>The GM's Principles</h2>\n<p>The following principles should be a guide: advice on what to do and not do in general. These aren’t specific instances of ‘<em>when X happens, do Y’,</em> but rather good ways to approach running a game of <strong>WFRP</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reveal the Old World</li>\n<li>Incorporate the Characters</li>\n<li>Embody Uncaring Gods</li>\n<li>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare 0  Focus on the Characters</li>\n<li>Everyone Has a History</li>\n<li>Lead the Players to Their Story 0 Be a Friend, and an Enemy</li>\n<li>Always Advance the Story </li>\n<li>Embrace Conflict</li>\n<li>Be Truthful (to Players)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reveal the Old World</h3>\n<p>The Old World isn’t like most fantasy lands. It is full of juxtapositions and conflicts: a middle class rising up from the oppressed peasants under the boot of the tyrannical nobility; the conflicts of doctrine between the preaching, doom-laden churches of the myriad cults; the screaming of babies with empty stomachs, drowned out by the crashing of plate armour, and the beat of drums as the Imperial Army marches by. The Old World is grim, gritty, and largely — but not entirely — without hope. Flickers of life, of happiness, and a gallows-humour peek through, which prove the indomitable spirit of Humanity, and shed light on Sigmar’s Heirs.</p>\n<p>You should work to cultivate knowledge, not just of the Old World as described in practical terms — the towns, rivers, forests, and so on — but also the themes and imagery that make it unique. You should consume media that shows off the glory and tragedy of the Renaissance, and then flood it with monsters, and magic at its edges.</p>\n<h3>Incorporate the Characters</h3>\n<p>Speak directly to the Characters, not the Players. State clearly the information that would be apparent to them. Remember that we, as people, take cues from our world: smells, sounds, the way someone twitches. These cues can be wrong, disguised, or misleading, but we still take them in. The Players should interrogate a scene by using their Character’s Skills, but you should be vigilant to give that information up front — and direct it at the Characters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: ‘Hans, you can tell the woman isn’t saying what she truly feels. You can’t tell why, but she’s holding something back, and her hand keeps slipping to the belt at her waist. She’s on edge, her eyes almost pleading with you not to force her to act rashly.’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage tells us a lot more than a clinical description of what’s happening: it breaths context and emotion into the Scene, and Hans’s Player will feel it more. It’s more visceral.</p>\n<h3>Embody Uncaring Gods</h3>\n<p>Look through the eyes of uncaring Gods! Nothing is sacred in the Old World, when you look at it from on high. Nothing is beyond being killed, burned, maimed, or crushed. Consider always how things could get worse, and put those threats against all of your creations. No NPC is safe, no boon given to a Character is permanent.</p>\n<p>Further, consider the malevolence of the Ruinous Powers. Always look for the failings in every Character that crosses your path. How can you tempt them? How can you corrupt them? How can you raise them up, only to bring them low again? Pull no punches.</p>\n<h3>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare</h3>\n<p>Reward evil, punish the good. Crime pays. Chaos runs rampant not through the lack of heroes, but the abundance of villains. The easy way out is almost always unclean. The right thing to do comes without reward, without celebration, and often with a knife in one’s back. Look always to offer easier solutions through compromised means, and stress that the world is unkind to optimists.</p>\n<h3>Focus on the Characters</h3>\n<p>Despite the Old World being an awful place to be, and our Characters are frequently far from heroes, in the end the story is about them. They may not always be the focal point of the stories unfolding around them, but they are our focus for how the story is told. They are our protagonists. You should be always hoping for the best for your Players’ Characters, whilst setting threats in their path. Every Combat should be one you hope they survive. Every moment your Players are on the edges of their seats, so you should be!</p>\n<p>But, like any good story, we can only hope if there is something threatening that hope. You are not focusing on your Characters if you fail to create appropriate challenges for them to tackle. By that same token, you do not focus on your Characters if you never let them celebrate, nor celebrate with them. You are not there to be their enemy, but to present enemies for them to — hopefully — overcome.</p>\n<h3>Everyone Has a History</h3>\n<p>Name everyone — give them a home and a heart. The Old World is made of regular people, not caricatures. Everyone has a name, a history, a home, and a heart. Though evil does truly exist in the Old World, it is almost always a tool to follow one’s ambitions and dreams. No one commits evil for no reason, not even the monsters of the deepest darkest places.</p>\n<p>You should strive to give a reason for things, and for the actions of the NPCs. These need not be complex, covering multiple pages of notes, but they should exist. A good rule is to give every NPC a Motivation and at least one Ambition.</p>\n<h3>Lead the Playres to Their Story</h3>\n<p>Ask leading questions, and build on the answers. Don’t just ask, ‘<em>Johann, you’re a soldier, do you have any scars?’ </em>but rather<em> ‘Johann, who gave you your worst scar, and how does that memory haunt you to this day?</em>’  The latter invites creativity far more than the former. It gives agency to a Player to describe their Character in depth. Further, the answers should be used by you at a later point to give weight to a Scene. Perhaps Johann got his scar from a Beastman’s axe? Later, maybe Johann finds a body in the forest, with wounds made by an axe that shares an uncomfortable similarity to his own scar…</p>\n<p>These questions can also be used to disclaim decision making, granting the authority to the Players. If they ask, ‘<em>Is there a chandelier in this room that I can swing off of?</em>’ you could answer ‘<em>Yes</em>,’ ‘<em>No</em>,’ or better yet, ‘<em>There wouldn’t normally be, but why don’t you tell me why there is?</em>’ These sorts of leading, disclaimed questions allow the Players to share in the world, and make it feel like their own.</p>\n<h3>Be a Friend, and an Enemy</h3>\n<p>Give with one hand, and take with the other. Warhammer isn’t about getting what you want. Or rather, it’s about getting what you want at horrendous cost. With every inch of ground the Characters claim, new problems, threats, and scars are sure to arise. They should pay for every victory in blood — often that of their enemies, but their own is very much on the line. Even simple things, like moving one rung up the social ladder, means someone else is displaced, and another enemy joins the fight against the Characters.</p>\n<h3>Always Advance the Story</h3>\n<p>Move off-screen, in the shadows. Whilst the story is about the Characters, it doesn’t revolve around them. Keep the action flowing in the background. Have your NPCs act without regard for the Characters; living their own lives, pursuing their own Ambitions. Don’t be afraid to ambush the Characters, or to have opportunities pass them by. The Old World isn’t waiting for them to solve its problems, but is driving full steam ahead toward the drop-off. If the Characters don’t get in the road, or try to change tracks, it’s gone — as it should be.</p>\n<p>This might mean that the Characters lose sometimes, or that they don’t have time to solve every problem. That’s perfect. In the real world, no one person has time to do everything, and can only act on their priorities. In the Old World, we can call our priorities our Ambitions — everything else has to fend for itself.</p>\n<h3>Embrace Conflict</h3>\n<p>Trust your Characters to create their own conflict. You rarely have to challenge the Characters directly to create conflict — trust in the Motivations and Ambitions of the Characters. Create situations that threaten those Ambitions, and promise Motivations, and your Players will get themselves into conflict. The best Adventures are ones the Characters choose to undertake themselves, so your job is to let them do that.</p>\n<h3>Be Truthful (To Players)</h3>\n<p>Speak truth to Players, speak lies to Characters. Never lie to your Players. Ever. But never tell your Characters the whole truth. This means being frank with your Players: tell them, right at the start, that not everything they’re told will be true. But when your Players ask a question — when they use their Skills to interrogate a scene — be truthful with the information they gain. If they succeed on their Perception Test, tell them truthfully what they find. If they fail on their Intuition Test, tell them what they truthfully believe. Make sure your Players know the difference between their knowledge, and the knowledge of their Characters. Make them understand the difference between those truths.</p>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":700001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":700001}}}

{"_id":"dqiHv9D7H6mZYc6i","name":"Do Me a Favor!","content":"<p>A Favour is a future burden you take on in return for immediate assistance of some sort. In the Old World, breaking one’s sworn word is considered bad form and carries significant social ramifications. no-one trusts oath breakers, meaning your @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Status} is reduced by 1. Powerful and dangerous folks tend to take it very, very poorly if someone refuses a Favour owed them, so bloody consequences may follow.</p>\n<p>The powerful often find it is far more useful to have various individuals owing them Favours than merely soliciting money in return for their help. What’s more, it can be an investment: help a student today, call in a favour from a successful Lawyer years later. Favours may be referred to as ‘boons’, ‘services’, or ‘obligations’ by different folk, but in the end, they all amount to the same.</p>\n<p>Favours come in three levels: Minor, Major, and Significant. Regardless of a Favour’s level, in almost all cases, the person owed the Favour will take into account the capabilities and sensibilities of the person they’re asking.

Because Sigmar was once the emperor, his worship is inextricably interwoven with politics, and three of the cult’s highest-ranking members are directly involved with electing new emperors. According to legend, 2,500 years ago Sigmar’s birth was heralded by a twin-tailed comet, and he was born the first son of the chief of the Unberogen tribe. When older, he received the magical warhammer Ghal-maraz (‘Skull-splitter’) as a gift from the Dwarf king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins. Sigmar later allied with the Dwarfs and their combined forces defeated the Greenskins. He was then crowned as the first emperor of the Human tribes he’d united. After fifty years of extraordinary rule, Sigmar mysteriously vanished, only to later ascend to divinity, crowned as a god by Ulric, Sigmar’s patron in life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Most folk of the Empire pay at least lip-service to their patron deity. In the most devout provinces, like Reikland, Sigmar worship is an unquestioned part of daily life. Folk attend weekly ‘throngs’ where the lessons of Sigmar are preached. Many also attend temple to train as local militia, confess sins and purify the soul, or receive advice on how to be more like the God-King of old.  Sigmar’s cult is comprised of an uncounted number of different orders. The largest is the Order of the Torch: Sigmar’s priests who lead their local communities. Other orders of importance include: the Order of the Cleansing Flame, comprised of inquisitors and witch hunters; the Order of the Silver Hammer, which includes warrior priests and yet more witch hunters; and the Order of the Anvil, a monastic order concerned with preserving Sigmar’s deeds and laws. The cult also has many templar orders. The most famous are the proud Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, the fanatical Knights of the Fiery Heart, and the militaristic Knights Griffon. Given the cult is so large, there are many different uniforms, vestments, and robes worn, all of which have different colours, cuts, and accessories according to local tradition and requirement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Every city, town, and village in the Empire has at least one temple to Sigmar. The Grand Cathedral in Altdorf is staffed by hundreds of priests and lay workers, and guarded by at least two orders of templars; at the other end of the scale, a village chapel may be visited just once every week by a travelling priest, who serves the needs of several small settlements.  Shrines can be found in most homes, and wayshrines dot every major highway, mostly marked with hammers or comets.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Sigmarite cultists may be ordered to destroy a cell of Chaos-worshippers, or expose a corrupt official who is secretly in league with the Ruinous Powers or a foreign power. It is also common to be tasked with building, or rebuilding, local communities to better promote unity and strength in the Empire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Obey your orders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Aid Dwarf-folk, never do them harm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Promote the unity of the Empire.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bear true allegiance to the imperial throne.</em></li>\n<li><em>Root out Greenskins, Chaos worshippers, and foul witches without mercy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Blessing of Might}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Dk0zjtcANtahntHx]{Beacon of Righteous Virtue}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Ffm7xIlRUWyacvKU]{Heed Not the Witch}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.WgZx3xma6vYGz17e]{Sigmar's Fiery Hammer}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.5fVTY8TSua3trOW8]{Soulfire}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rjkMzFwN1trbSLL8]{Twin-tailed Comet}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.I8YPP2uRmUKyHEq2]{Vanquish the Unrighteous}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/sigmar.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":900001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":900001}}}

Despite its ever-increasing size, travelers note Dunkelberg’s ‘rustic’ feel, with regular markets clogging its winding streets.

Visitors to Dunkelberg may be shocked to see so many urchins deployed as a labour force, though the callous disregard many of the wealthy of the town have developed toward orphan children is perhaps worse.

So, the only way is up, and each has commissioned tall towers be built atop their manors.

If you Charge, your Action must be a Melee Test to attack an opponent. If your opponent is at least your Move characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your Run range (see the Run entry in the Movement Table for how far you can move when Charging), you will also gain +1 Advantage as you barrel into your opponent.</p>\n<h4>Disengaging</h4>\n<p>If you are @JournalEntry[fysKUlMiHSkbFnWy]{Engaged} in combat, and no longer wish to be trading blows with your opponent, you have the following two options for leaving combat safely.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Advantage</strong>: If you have more Advantage than your opponents, you are in a superior position and can easily </p>\n<p>manoeuvre yourself beyond reach. If you choose to drop your Advantage to 0, you can move away from your opponents without penalty, perhaps choosing to Charge a new target, run away as fast as possible, or backstep a little and fire a pistol in an opponent’s face!</p>\n<p><strong>Use Dodge</strong>: If you have lower or equal Advantage to your opponents or do not wish to spend your Advantage, you are pinned in place. If you wish to escape, you will need to use your Action to make an <strong>Opposed Dodge/Melee</strong> Test. If you succeed, you gain +1 Advantage, and can use your Move to go anywhere you wish using the normal rules. If you fail, each opponent defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible for you to escape without a blow to your back.</p>\n<h4>Fleeing</h4>\n<p>If you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee as your Move. Often, Fleeing is involuntary, caused by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror} or magic.</p>\n<p>If you flee, your opponent immediately gains 1 Advantage and may attempt 1 free attack. The free attack is an unopposed Melee Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL scored to Damage you as normal. As you are throwing caution to the wind, your opponent gains +20 to hit you. If you are hit, your opponent gains +1 Advantage, and you must enact a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test: if failed, gain a Broken Condition, and a further +1 @Condition[Broken] condition per SL below 0.  Once the free attack is concluded, you may move up to your Run Movement (see the Movement Table) directly away from your opponent, assuming you still can.</p>\n<h4>Running</h4>\n<p>On your turn, you can use your Action to sprint. This requires an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test, and the distance covered is in addition to your Move this round. You sprint your Run movement + SL in yards (see the Movement Table for your Run movement). So, a character with Move 4 who rolled –2 SL would sprint an additional 14 yards (16–2=14).</p>\n<h4>Climbing</h4>\n<p>Most climb moves won’t need Tests. Climbing rules are only required when the Climb is difficult or if knowing exactly how long you take to ascend is important.</p>\n<p>Climbing a ladder or similarly easy-to-climb surface does not require a Test but does slow you down. You move at half rate up or down ladders or other easily climbed surfaces. So, it would cost 4 yards of your Movement to climb a 2-yard ladder. If you want to climb more quickly, spend your Action to make an <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test. You will Climb an extra Movement + SL yards. So, a character with Movement 4 who rolled +2 SL will climb an additional 6 yards (4+2=6).</p>\n<p>If both hands are free, you can climb a surface with suitable handholds with a Climb Test using your Action for the turn. You ascend or descend at a rate of ½ Movement + SL in yards.</p>\n<p>Climbing difficulty is set by the GM and varies with the nature of the climbed surface. Some climbs will be beyond the ability of most characters without the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} Talent.</p>","folder":"BwGBqjkeBJcgiZyn","sort":1,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Moving"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Moving","sort":1}}}

{"_id":"fayg5SA1zaVnQKoH","name":"Attributes","content":"<h2>Attributes</h2>\n<p>Attributes describe your character’s innate capabilities – how fast or strong you are, how much damage you can sustain, or how well you cope with stressful situations. Attributes include Movement, ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Wait! That's Not Fair!</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">You may notice that not all characters are created equal. An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example. Don’t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects to character generation and all the Species have advantages and disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests, to determine if you perform an action successfully. The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p>\n<h4>Determining Characteristics</h4>\n<p>When determining your Characteristics: </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1) </strong>Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP. </p>\n<p><strong>Step 2) </strong>Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you’re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3) </strong>If you’re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.</p>\n<h4>Weapon Skill (WS)</h4>\n<p>Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is the weapon!</p>\n<h4>Ballistic Skill (BS)</h4>\n<p>Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.</p>\n<h4>Strength (S)</h4>\n<p>How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.</p>\n<h4>Toughness (T)</h4>\n<p>Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and standing up to poison.</p>\n<h4>Initiative (I)</h4>\n<p>Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of intuition and perception.</p>\n<h4>Agility (Ag)</h4>\n<p>Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for dodging blows in combat.</p>\n<h4>Dexterity (Dex)</h4>\n<p>Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.</p>\n<h4>Intelligence (Int)</h4>\n<p>Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the understanding and casting of magical spells.</p>\n<h4>Willpower (WP)</h4>\n<p>General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.</p>\n<p>Fellowship (Fel)</p>\n<p>Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with your deity.</p>\n<h4>Characteristic Bonuses</h4>\n<p>The first or ‘tens’ digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways throughout the rules, particularly for limiting Talents and defining Spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3. Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5.</p>\n<h3>Wounds (W)</h3>\n<p>Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See  Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage.</p>\n<h4>Determining Wounds</h4>\n<p>Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus,, and Willpower Bonus (abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses used to calculate your Wounds. Note: Halflings have the Small Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}).</p>\n<h3>Fate &amp; Fortune, Resilience &amp; Resolve</h3>\n<p>Your Fate represents your destiny, and is directly tied to your Fortune, a measure of your luck. Your Resilience is your inner strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your grit. Your Resilience also comes with a Motivation, which is a single word or phrase describing what drives your character forwards. See @JournalEntry[01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl]{Fate and Resilience} for more on all of these.</p>\n<h4>Determining Fate and Resilience</h4>\n<p>You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are. By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through any situation.</p>\n<h4>Determining Fortune and Resolve</h4>\n<p>Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate. Your initial Resolve equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.</p>\n<h4>Determining Motivation</h4>\n<p>All characters choose a Motivation. It represents your Character’s core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for. In addition to the obvious roleplaying benefits for portraying your character, Motivation is used to help you regain Resolve points. When considering your Motivation, think of something that is fundamental to your character’s nature. Also try to make your Motivation something fun to roleplay, and something that will work well with the other PCs and their motivations.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf, has ‘Thrillseeker’ for his Motivation. He lives his life in pursuit of excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has ‘Protect the weak’ as her Motivation. She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts, risking life and limb to save the Reikland’s citizenry. Clotilda will regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in harm’s way to protect another.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Ebba is a ‘Rebellious’ apprentice wizard studying at the Light College. She loves to break the rules of the College, flaunting her master’s authority, and poking her nose into books best left undisturbed. She regains Resolve whenever she breaks the rules set for her by superiors.</em></p>\n<p>Other examples of potential motivations include: a ‘Perfectionist’, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy from flawless execution of schemes; a ‘Nurturer’, who gains strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult situations; a ‘Penitent Martyr’, who revels in hardship to atone for past misdeeds; or a ‘Shining Wit’, who’s ever engaging in witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood. If you can’t think of a Motivation don’t worry. One may arise as you create more of your character, and the other players and the GM can always help. Even if you do have one, it’s possible you may change your mind later. @JournalEntry[XUxruxa3RZeZVceD]{Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life} is a good time to reconsider what your Motivation will be.</p>\n<h4>Movement (M)</h4>\n<p>Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed. Standard Human Movement is 4. If using a grid for movement this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or inches across the table top. Over the longer term it indicates how many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot. For more on Movement, see @JournalEntry[efIMLdnXk5Y7leLu]{Moving During Combat}</p>\n<h3>Advance Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Upon selecting a career as \"Current\", you will see small \"plus\" symbols appear next to certain characteristics. You can allocate a total of 5 advances across these characteristics as you choose. Enter these advances in manually, as clicking the plus symbols to advance will spend experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Characteristic Advances</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characteristic Advances show training or experience in your Characteristics. The number of Advances you have in the Characteristic is added to the initial Characteristic to show your current ability. So, if you have an initial Dexterity of 25, and 5 Dexterity Advances, your Dexterity is now 30.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"hflpTOpbTqmvqIxi","sort":25001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Character","sort":25001}}}
{"_id":"fysKUlMiHSkbFnWy","name":"Attacking","content":"<p>One of the most common Actions is to attack an opponent. To make a ranged attack, your weapon must be in range and your target visible in line-of-sight. For melee attacks, you must be adjacent your target with a weapon ready (see Engaged).</p>\n<h4>1: Roll to Hit</h4>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong>: To attack, perform an Opposed Melee Test with your Opponent (both you and your opponent Test your Melee Skill). Whoever scores the highest SL wins. If you win the Test, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you lose the Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and your Action is finished.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged</strong>: Roll a Ranged Test for the weapon you’re using. If you are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you fail, your Action is over. Your opponent doesn’t gain Advantage in ranged combat.</p>\n<p>In both melee and ranged Combat, it’s possible to score an impressive hit called a Critical, or to make a mistake, called a Fumble. See Criticals and Fumbles in the section below.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Test to hit your opponent with your weapon. This Test is Opposed in melee. Any winner gains +1 Advantage.</em></p>\n<h4>2: Determine Hit Location</h4>\n<p>If you successfully hit, find out where — reverse the roll to hit and compare this number to the Hit Locations table. So, a roll of 23 to hit would become 32 on the table, a hit on the Right Arm.</p>\n<p>Creatures with different body shapes may use different hit location tables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>Location is <strong>not reversed </strong>in Foundry. Instead, an entirely separate dice roll is performed to find the location. Additionally, you can assign a creature a specific hit location table in the configuration menu, accessible by the \"Configure\" button at the top of the sheet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>3: Determine Damage</h4>\n<p>Once you have determined the hit location, it is time to work out how much Damage you deal. Each weapon has a Weapon Damage characteristic. This is usually your modified Strength Bonus for melee weapons, or a fixed number for ranged weapons. Take the SL of your Opposed Test and add it to the Weapon Damage of the weapon you’re using. This final number is your Damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><em>: Damage = Weapon Damage + SL</em></p>\n<h4>4: Apply Damage</h4>\n<p>Using the Damage and the Hit Location you struck, you now see how many Wounds your opponent loses from your attack. Subtract your opponent’s Toughness Bonus and any Armour Points protecting the Hit Location from your Damage. The remaining Damage is suffered as Wounds by your opponent. If this is 1 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the worst of the attack and only loses 1 Wound.  Should the Wounds lost exceed your opponent’s remaining Wounds total, your opponent takes a Critical Wound and gains the @Condition[Prone] Condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Wounds Suffered = Damage – opponent’s (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Opposing A Melee Attack</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">You can Oppose an incoming melee attack with more than just your Melee Skill. The most obvious choice is Dodge, which allows you to avoid incoming blows, but there are many other Skills that just might be useful in combat, including Intimidate, Charm, Leadership, and more. If your GM thinks it’s appropriate for the situation, and you’re happy missing out on the opportunity to score a Critical Hit against your opponent, then why not give it a go.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Engaged</h4>\n<p>Whenever you attack an opponent, or are attacked, in melee combat, you count as Engaged. This means you are tussling with each other in a fight, and others rules (due to Talents, Spells, etc.) for being Engaged might apply. If you don’t attack each other for a full Round, you are no longer Engaged.</p>","img":null,"folder":"fB8m4sZ2E3sMgszX","sort":25001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Combat","sort":25001}}}

The following explains how to heal Wounds and Critical Wounds.</p>\n<h4><strong>Healing Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>You are considered wounded if you have lost any of your Wounds. </p>\n<p>Without medical attention, you can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test after a good sleep once a day. You Heal Wounds equal to the SL + your Toughness Bonus. For each day you spend taking it easy, you also heal an extra number of Wounds equal to your Toughness Bonus. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: This can be done automatically in the main tab of the character sheet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you wish to Heal more Wounds than this, then you need to be attended by someone with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.HXZaV1CJhmTvcAz4]{Heal} skill or you’ll need bandages, a healing poultice, or similar.</p>\n<p>There is no penalty for being wounded. Lost Wounds are considered to be small cuts, bruises, and other easily ignored injuries.</p>\n<h4>Healing Critical Wounds</h4>\n<p>If you have received any Critical Wounds, you are said to be Critically Wounded. Critical Wounds can be very serious. Refer to the appropriate Critical Table to see exactly what penalties you suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained. Critical Wounds do not count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved. When you are Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the normal rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Medical Attention</strong></h3>\n<p>Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved until you receive medical attention. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Successful use of the Heal skill.</li>\n<li>Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar.</li>\n<li>Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Surgery</strong></h4>\n<p>Some wounds are beyond simple stitching and foul-smelling poultices. If you suffer a Critical Wound where surgery is required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer the marked penalties until you visit an appropriately trained doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine surgery equivalent.</p>\n<p>Further, if you suffer an amputated body part, you cannot heal 1 of the suffered Wounds until a surgeon successfully treats it with a Heal Test.

{"_id":"hGeXud7E91sHnz0w","name":"Magic Rules","content":"<h3>Second Sight</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent allows you to perceive the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around you. Second Sight affects all your senses, and how it manifests is dependent on individual experience and training: So, where Aqshy may have a hot, cinnamon odour to one pyromancer, it could feel like searing ear itches to another.</p>\n<p>If you have Second Sight, you may use any appropriate Skills with your aethyric senses, most commonly your Intuition, Perception, and Track Skills. For example, a wizard following the trail of a fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces of Dhar in the witch’s path, rather than their literal footsteps. Or a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely. Like the mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have no truck with the Winds of Magic but cannot help what they perceive. This means the GM may request Tests, or take Tests on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your surrounding environment, even if you’re not looking for them.</p>\n<p>Spells</p>\n<p>There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. Chaos spells are those practiced by those who’ve lost their souls to Chaos.</p>\n<h4>Memorising Spells</h4>\n<p>Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick) in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell. </p>\n<p>To memorise a spell — and therefore be able to cast it without access to your grimoire — you typically need to spend the amount of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent. Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.</p>\n<h3>Casting Test</h3>\n<p>To cast a spell, make a <strong>Language (Magick) </strong>Test. If you succeed, match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in the individual spell description). If your SL is equal to or higher than the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell’s description. If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens.</p>\n<h4>Critical Casting</h4>\n<p>If the casting roll is a Critical, the Winds of Magic have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at a cost. Unless you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.BYChSVfMG004eflQ]{Instinctive Diction} Talent, you roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} as the power moves beyond your control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Critical Cast</strong>: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a Critical Wound.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Power</strong>: The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.</li>\n<li><strong>Unstoppable Force</strong>: If you scored enough SL to cast your spell, it cannot be Dispelled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Fumbled Casting</h4>\n<p>If you lose control of the magical energy you are channelling, things invariably go awry. If you Fumble your Casting Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}.<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Malignant Influence</em></h3>\n<p><em>Casting close to sources of Corruption makes controlling the Winds of Magic much more difficult. When attempting a Language (Magick) or Channelling Test in the vicinity of a @JournalEntry[u7IJ1xm4pO5s9QgS]{Corrupting Influence}, any roll of an 8 (representing the eight-pointed symbol of Chaos) on the units die results in a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} as the Magic goes wild. If you already have a Minor Miscast on the Test for another reason, the Miscast escalates to a @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast}.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>This is available through a checkbox in the roll dialog</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration unless it is dispelled. You may not simply end your spells already in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them. </p>\n<h4>Grimoires</h4>\n<p>Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master, while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore they possess. Doing so doubles the Casting Number.</p>\n<h4>Magic Missiles</h4>\n<p>Some spells are marked as magic missiles ; these are damage-causing spells that all follow the same rules. When a magic missile is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the @Table[hitloc]{Hit Location Table}. The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is added to the spell’s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness and Armour Points as normal. </p>\n<h4>Touch Spells in Combat</h4>\n<p>Certain spells require you to touch the target. If in combat, or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an <strong>Opposed Melee (Brawling) </strong>Test (generally opposed by the Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test. If you do this and your spell was a magic missile , the Melee (Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not the Language (Magick) Test.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate ingredient before unleashing their spells. Doing this offers protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the worst of any magical backlash. </p>\n<p>If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.</p>\n<p>Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual spell lists.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak — not gagged, strangled, or underwater — to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly, and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder the spell is chanted.</p>\n<p>Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10 Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30.</p>\n<p>Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to see — i.e. have Line of Sight — to your target.</p>\n<h3>Channelling Test</h3>\n<p>Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill. Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure, but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test. </p>\n<p>When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the chosen spell’s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.</p>\n<h4>Critical Channelling</h4>\n<p>If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round regardless of the SL you’ve scored in the Extended Test so far; however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the Minor Miscast Table unless you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1IZWRr7BYOIcqPlQ]{Aethyric Attunement} Talent.</p>\n<h4>Fumble</h4>\n<p>Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous. You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the Major Miscast Table.</p>\n<h4>Interruptions</h4>\n<p>Concentration is vital when channelling. If you are distracted by anything — loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights, or similar — you must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Cool </strong>Test, or suffer a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended Channelling Test so far.</p>\n<h3>Repelling the Winds</h3>\n<p>Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are manipulating helps attract the magic to you. This is the reason most wizards choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order. </p>\n<p>All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a –1 SL penalty if you are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying to attract, as determined by the GM. Specifically, metal and leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the golden wind Chamon , while leather retains traces of the amber Ghur . As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL penalty to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point on the location with the most armour. Casters with the <em>Arcane Magic (Metal) </em>Talent may wear metal armour without penalty; those with <em>Arcane Magic (Beasts)</em> Talent may ignore penalties from leather armour. </p>\n<h3>Dispelling</h3>\n<p>If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards, you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you chant a counterspell. Make an Opposed Language (Magick) Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine whether the casting was successful as normal. You may only attempt to dispel a single spell every Round.</p>\n<h4>Dispelling Persistent Spells</h4>\n<p>If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell for your Action. This is done by making an <strong>Extended Language (Magick)</strong> Test. When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing spell, you successfully dispel it.</p>\n<p>Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll separately. If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to make an Assisted Test instead.</p>\n<h3>Using Warpstone</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Officially the use of warpstone is precluded by the powers that be. Unofficially, I can say that it is officially never used within this college. Officially, I cannot say what unofficial uses it might have. But unofficially, I might be able to say it has certain unofficial uses. But certainly it is officially unofficial.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>–Wilhelm Holswig-Schliestein, Grey Guardian, Raconteur, and Liar</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Warpstone is such a rich source of power that even a small fragment of the stuff will offer enough magic to power any spell in short order. Of course, the wisdom of powering any spell with Warpstone, and the wisdom of carrying Warpstone upon your person, is debateable. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A wizard using Warpstone when Casting and Channelling doubles their SL for the appropriate tests.

{"_id":"hqwteGSoejcwnhuy","name":"The Themes of Warhammer","content":"<p>WFRP focuses on the following five themes. The conflicts created by these five themes can fuel almost any Adventure. And ultimately, these themes coalesce into the main looming peril of the setting: <em>The End Times</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Struggle — Rich vs Poor</li>\n<li>Ideology — Order vs Chaos</li>\n<li>Modernisation — Urban vs Rural</li>\n<li>Factionalism — Us vs Them</li>\n<li>Religion — Cult vs Cult</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Class Struggle</h3>\n<p>Class struggle underpins a lot of the Empire — rich vs poor. Given <strong>WFRP </strong>is focused on the everyday lives turned grim adventures of Imperial citizens, it is one that is seen everywhere. The poor under classes are constantly being pushed around by the rich upper class. The burgeoning middle class is driving a wedge between the two and making both, in many ways, redundant. Wealth, once clutched in the hands of the elite, is being hoarded by those who were born peasants, or whose parents worked the fields in serfdom. This struggle brings revolutionaries, agitators, criminals, and tyrants on to the centre stage, and helps feed into the conflicts presented in all four other major themes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Herr Dohrmann is a ‘merchant’ in the ‘very short-term loan’ business. Dohrmann is always looking for a ‘few steady hands’ to collect on his overdue accounts, occasionally with some violent interest. Characters working for Dohrmann soon find themselves collecting purses of silver from folk living in muddy hovels, while conversely stripping destitute nobles of their still-valuable, if faded, garments.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Roswitha Sprenge is a malcontent demanding better treatment for the dockworkers of Kemperbad. While some of her points are valid, when the local merchant council actually tried to address her complaints, she immediately brought up new grievances and her rhetoric turned violent. The merchants want to know if she is an agitator with a grudge or a paid agent of nobles seeking to destabilize the freistadt.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>There is nothing to be done. The Baron Meinhard Tussen-Hochen is clearly within his rights to punish his peasants that fail to meet their grain quotas. That he should choose to hunt down and slaughter entire families via horseback with Blackpowder weapons is also his right. His fellow nobles will not intervene, the merchants cannot, and the commoners dare not. Will the Characters act or turn away?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ideology</h3>\n<p>Ideology is perhaps the main theme of Warhammer, but exists as a backdrop in the Empire — outside the walls is the untamed wilderness, filled with monsters and the hordes of Chaos, whilst inside them is the order of civilisation. This is, at least, how the powers that be in the Empire want it to seem, but everything exists in a liminal space between the two — Order vs Chaos. Mutants and Beastmen exist as clear evidence that it’s not black and white. Wizards represent Chaos-turned-Order. The barbarism of Witch Hunters, nominally agents of Order, is nothing short of Chaotic. The ever-present Chaos cultists — the dreaded Enemy Within — are everywhere in the Empire. This struggle is what eventually breaks the Old World in half, and leads to the End Times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Characters are hired by faithful Shallyans to act as guards for the compassionate Doktor Carsta Velsinger, a gifted physician who administers to the poor for a pittance, but is in danger of being overrun by her many frantic would-be patients, and eliminated by agents of other less empathetic doktors who would see her ‘removed’. The real question, though, is what will the Characters do when they discover she is a mutant?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Two whole villages burned, all their folk executed, for ‘heresy and acts of sedition against the Empire’ by the Witch Hunter Lothar Rieger — a man that everyone fervently praises, so long as his attention is turned elsewhere. Now, he has apparently set his sights on a village that holds friends and family of the Characters. Does Rieger even believe in innocence, or is he an agent of Chaos, unwitting or otherwise?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>While travelling by coach through the Reikwald, the Characters are waylaid by a large motley band but promised, in Ranald’s name, that no harm will come to them. It seems that the Outlaw Judge Jirl Strauchrichter needs some ‘objective’ jurists to help with the trial of some bandits who may have turned to Chaos and preying on their fellows. The Characters may learn some strange new ideas from Strauchrichter, who was named an Outlaw because he has odd notions, like people should be considered innocent until proven guilty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Modernisation</h3>\n<p>The Empire is in a state of industrialisation and innovation. Modernisation stretches out beyond the towns into the country increasing tensions — urban vs rural. The printing press puts reading and writing, once the purview of a select few, into the hands of commoners and pamphleteers. Black powder gives the power of the warrior elite to anyone who can point a metal tube at their neighbour and pull the trigger. Innovations in agriculture and manufacturing are seeing a glut of resources flowing into urban centres, which are becoming increasingly separate from their rural dependants. And the advances made in land and sea travel are making what was once a world of isolated pockets of civilisation into… something else. This, of course, brings resentment, and draws a far starker line between the other conflicts. Two peasants may be of the same status, but one can read, has travelled the world, and has seen the face of the Emperor, whilst the other knows only a pitchfork, immediate family, and the plot of land they are forced to work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professor Glockauer of the Imperial Engineers’ School of Altdorf has announced that he will soon unveil a radical new invention — a farming machine able to harvest whole fields in minutes. A group of Village Elders, concerned they may soon be rendered obsolete, hires the Characters to subtlety sabotage the machine so it will fail spectacularly when displayed.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>During a recent border skirmish between provinces, the Knights of the Sacred Flame suffered a disastrous defeat when a number of their fellows were gunned down by State Troop Handgunners. Their incensed Grand Master Feutchwanger has declared Blackpowder weapons should no longer be wielded by commoners and has already drawn many nobles sympathetic to his view. The Characters are hired by Nuln agents to convince him otherwise, or ‘remove’ him, if necessary.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Apothecary Anja Schwann has systematically expanded her business by making generic medicines using a ‘production line’ of workers. Her drugs aren’t nearly as effective as ones made following traditional ways, but they are far cheaper. The Dwarf Herbalist Kallon Rosewarden is furious with Schwann, both for abasing his work and for her business’ voracious despoiling of the herbs he needs. He hires the Characters to replace a few of Schwann’s medicines with some concoctions of his own.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Factionalism</h3>\n<p>Warhammer is filled with factions that operate under an us vs them mentality — the Elves vs the Dwarfs, the Empire vs Bretonnia, Reiklanders vs Middenlanders, Altdorfers vs Ubersreikers… Identity is everything, and unswerving allegiance to such, and the conflicts that that allegiance causes, are integral. As are the juxtapositions, stereotypes, and exceptions to that rule. Consider the stories told through the stubbornness of Dwarfs and Elves attempting to work together, or a Dwarf Slayer’s unlikely growing respect for an inexperienced Manling agitator. Often this theme is set against a backdrop of ridiculousness and farce — the conflicts are there, but if everyone just set aside their differences, things would go much smoother. And yet, there’s always someone ready to stoke those fires once more, and unpick any steps towards progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trouble’s brewing on the docks as the Halfling Gaffers Guild recently started having their Ogre labourers haul all their building materials, bypassing the Human Stevedore Guild. The Halflings say they’ve done this because the Stevedores regularly overcharge them, while the Stevedores claim the Halflings unfairly demand that they haul as much as the Ogres can, at just as quick a pace. Both sides want the Characters’ help against the other, with each implying the real problem is just prejudice from the other side.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The infamous bandit Gerlach the Gouger has finally been caught, but what should be a cause for celebration has turned nasty. As Gerlach was apprehended at a river crossing, patrols of both Road Wardens and Riverwardens are now claiming the collar, along with the heavy prize purse for catching the cruel Gouger. A fight is imminent, will the Characters help negotiate or grab the Gouger for themselves during the scuffle?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Jade Wizard Kistiane Brockdorf is tired of the endless suspicion she receives at the local market, the aggression of the Watch, and the relentless attention of the Witch Hunter Armin Geringliebe. She decides to give a series of free talks wherein she discusses the role of Wizards in the Empire and shows off a little useful Jade magic, so she hires the Characters to ‘occupy’ the Witch Hunter. The Characters soon discover that Geringliebe is anxious to attend each lecture but, strangely enough, desperate to prevent other Witch Hunters from doing so. It couldn’t be that he’s smitten with the beautiful Druid, could it?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>The Cults of the Empire’s religions are beset on all sides — fighting Chaos, monsters, magic, heresy, and each other: cult vs cult. Whether it’s Ulricans vs Sigmarites, Ulricans vs Taalites, Verenans vs Rhyans, or any other combination of conflicts, the Cults of the Empire are at each other's throats. Furthermore, the Cults are as political as any other group, and often more so than most. This leads to constant infighting, schisming, purges, synods, and other falling-outs among the Faithful. This constant squabbling from supposedly enlightened folk is a perfect symbol of the futility of the Warhammer world. The Gods may or may not be watching over us. They may or may not care what’s happening. Sure, they send us Miracles and Chosen to aid us in times of darkness… but they do nothing to keep their own houses in order, and show no signs of steering their own clergy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poor folk of Geetberg are desperate, for a plague has afflicted them all, but the medicine needed to cure it is more costly than they can afford. A Priest of Ranald has a solution — use the silver coins interred on the eyes of the dead to save the living, but the Priests of Morr have forbidden it. Are the Characters up for some ‘noble’ graverobbing?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Captain Rainer Brusdal of Middenland is offering gold to any mercenaries willing to join the final assault of a heavily fortified bandit stronghold in the Drakwald Forest. The attack will be near-suicidal as his martial advisor, Brother Ansgar, has rejected the cunning battle plan of Sister Dacia of Myrmidia as cowardly, though it would likely save many lives, in favour of an open forward assault to honour Ulric. The Sister’s plan doesn’t need many warriors though…<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A Warrior Priest of Sigmar, Father Helmut, has tried and convicted a squad of soldiers for failing to obey orders and abandoning their duty guarding one of Sigmar’s temples. Father Helmut doesn’t care that their town was on fire, or that lives were at stake — orders are orders. The Verenan Lorekeeper Irmgard will not let this injustice pass and, despite the potential ramifications, seeks to hire some brave souls to spirit the soldiers away before their execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The End Times?</h3>\n<p>Agitators, seers, and the insane have been declaring the end of the world for many centuries, without seeming effect, but the recent auguries are the most accurate yet. It seems the long-dreaded End Times may be at hand. What does it mean to adventure in a world seemingly headed for inevitable destruction? Are the Characters’ actions still important, or is the very notion of ‘heroics’ meaningless in the face of a looming apocalypse?</p>\n<p>Questions such as these are fundamental to the Warhammer experience, and are one of the main reasons why the focus for <strong>WFRP </strong>is on everyday people. We tell stories about a group of largely ordinary folks marked out for something extraordinary, and then get to see what happens. Will they learn of the pending doom? Will they stand against it? Will they be brought low and succumb to their baser instincts?</p>\n<p>We can’t answer these questions, nor would we, if we could. If each Campaign is built around answering a question, then <em>all </em><strong>WFRP </strong>Campaigns together are ultimately about these questions. As the GM, it’s worth presenting these questions and this theme, behind many threats, if the Characters dig deep enough.</p>\n<p>But the Old World is not without hope, nor without heroism. It’s up to your Players to decide how their Characters face the coming apocalypse and if, ultimately, they can avert it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A blind mystic accosts a Rogue Character on the street, seizes their arm, and whispers, <em>‘You will be the one to fulfil the Architect’s Plan, but it is not too late, turn back! Abandon this course while you still can!</em>’ The mystic then suddenly looks frightened and runs away. The Character is soon approached with several intriguing job offers, all of which sound very lucrative, involving thefts of holy relics. That night, they hear about an inexplicable fire that only took the life of one old witch…<br /><br /></li>\n<li>It is an open secret that the number of mutant births is on the rise, as are instances of spontaneous mutation. The Lady Silk Shein’s sideline business involving barber-surgeons removing ‘unwanted growths’ and ‘relocating sadly stunted babes’ is booming. She offers the Characters an exceedingly generous retainer to work for her. The job includes eliminating anyone interested in stopping the mutations or seeking their source. After all, can’t let a looming apocalypse interfere with the bottom line.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Word has slipped out that in a small village deep in the Reikwald, a child has been born with birthmarks that resemble both the Twin-Tailed Comet and the dreaded Star of Chaos. Old prophecies speak of such a child, saying that they are marked for great and terrible purpose during the End Times. Now, multiple factions seek to hire the Characters to kidnap the child, protect the child, eliminate the child, etc. Whatever course they choose, someone powerful will be furious with them.</li>\n</ul>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":800001}}}

Whenever trouble arises, the nearby townsfolk of Wheburg cast an eye towards the mountain and make the comet sign of Sigmar to ward evil, for Drachenberg has a fell reputation.

However, if you take Ingotfist a cask of Bugman’s finest beer, it’s said she’ll spill any secret when deep in her cups.

Perhaps because of these, the Hägercrybs have a foul reputation for being haunted, and few are willing to stray too deep into its forests. It is said those who do encounter thick fogs rising from ancient barrows, with moans of the dead echoing from within.

Because of this, the town regularly sees traders and travellers from across the Old World. The mighty fortress known as the Black Rock is connected to the walls of the town should any less welcome travellers attempt ingress. Ubersreik has had a long association with the nearby Dwarven clans of the Grey Mountains, and in a situation unique to Ubersreik, representatives of the city’s Dwarf population sit on the town council. One of Ubersreik’s more famous edifices, its spectacular bridge over the River Teufel, was built by Dwarfs during the time of Magnus the Pious. Widely regarded as one of the most impressive feats of engineering to be found in the Reikland, it connects the trade road which runs all the way from Bögenhafen to Dunkelberg then Nuln.

Some, he swears, are number-shaped, like measurements or directions, with shapes that look like a large gate-structure. What’s more, he swears strange scratching noises have joined the usual skittering sounds of his quarry, like quill on parchment. Is it possible that the rats have learned to read and write? Whatever the case, Rattenfanger is looking for bodyguards, and folks could do far worse than getting such a knowledgeable guide to Ubersreik on their side.

{"_id":"j1pFLzKRxekSkLtX","name":"Craftsmanship","content":"<p>The items available in the shops, stalls, and merchant halls of the Empire vary significantly in quality. Not everything is made equal, and the Craftsmanship rules reflect this using Item Qualities, and Item Flaws.</p>\n<p>An Item Quality makes the trapping a little better, but harder to find. An Item Flaw makes the trapping a little worse, but easier to find.</p>\n<h3>Item Qualities</h3>\n<p>A Trapping is called a Quality Trapping if it has more Item Qualities than Flaws. For each Item Quality the Trapping has, double its price and make it one step less available. A Trapping with more Qualities than its Encumbrance, and that lacks any Flaws, is called a Best Quality Trapping.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A spade that has the Fine and Durable Item Qualities costs quadruple the list price, and drops availability from Common to Rare.</em></p>\n<h4>Durable</h4>\n<p>Laboriously crafted using strong materials, the item can take +Durable Damage points before it suffers any negatives (see @JournalEntry[ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO]{Weapon Damage} and @JournalEntry[10LxsWBSwEmjZWeV]{Armour Damage}) and gains a saving throw of 9+ on a 1d10 roll against instant breakage from sources like Trap Blade (see @JournalEntry[ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO]{Weapons}). This Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molli owns a high quality sword with Durable 3, meaning it can take 3 Damage before suffering any negatives, and has a saving throw of 7+ against breaking. </em></p>\n<h4>Fine</h4>\n<p>Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of social status and can be taken multiple times. The higher the quality, the more impressive it seems.</p>\n<h4>Lightweight</h4>\n<p>Cleverly crafted for ease of carrying. Reduce Encumbrance points by 1.</p>\n<h4>Practical</h4>\n<p>Expertly crafted with utility in mind. A failed test using this item receives +1 SL. If the item is a piece of armour, any penalties for wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from −30 to −20).</p>\n<h3>Item Flaws</h3>\n<p>A Trapping is called a Flawed Trapping if it has more Item Flaws than Qualities. Each Flaw halves the listed price and improves Availability by one step. Many vendors sell flawed items, but pretend they are anything but. A successful Test with any appropriate skill — such as Evaluate, or Melee for weapons, or Trade for tools — will spot such underhanded activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by being Flawed — they are always difficult to find, even shoddy examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A suit of chainmail that is both Bulky and Unreliable costs a quarter of the list price, and raises Availability from Rare to Common.</em></p>\n<h4>Ugly</h4>\n<p>Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a –10 penalty.</p>\n<h4>Shoddy</h4>\n<p>Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster. The item breaks when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy armour breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location it protects.</p>\n<h4>Unreliable</h4>\n<p>Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armour are doubled.</p>\n<h4>Bulky</h4>\n<p>An awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this flaw). Bulky clothing and armour are Enc 1 even when worn, and Fatigue penalties for armour are doubled.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Crafting Guilds</em></h3>\n<p><em>Most Artisans in the Empire are members of guilds that protect their rights and ensure appropriate standards of craftsmanship.

The GM may prefer to roleplay every visit to each market, hawker, or shop, meaning Tests for Availability are unrequired as the GM simply states what is or isn’t purchasable.

If an item costs less than your Status level — so if you have a Status of Silver 2, any item costing 2 silver shillings or less — you are assumed to be able to buy as much as needed of that item.

As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single item in stock, towns have [[/r 1d10]] items, and cities have as many as the GM deems appropriate. These quantities are generally doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding up).</p>\n<h3>Bargaining and Trading</h3>\n<p>People of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals. When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test: Evaluate and Haggle.</p>\n<p>Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item. Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits. Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or Exotic items to within +/-10%.</p>\n<p>Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike, typically with Opposed Tests. Haggling is expected and most prices are marked up slightly to account for this. Winning a Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20% with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker} Talent). Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts your coinage.</p>\n<h4>Roleplaying Shopping Trips</h4>\n<p>Trips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be roleplayed in detail. The GM might prefer you browse the equipment lists and check for Availability yourself. Major purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character. In certain scenarios, shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them. Consider the following when roleplaying shopping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local details. For example, basic rowboats are automatically available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that features a renowned boat-builder.</li>\n<li>Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20%if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day shopping and making Gossip Tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Selling</h3>\n<p>Selling your trappings during desperate times, or simply offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying, but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it. So, you first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as checking for stock. You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a price. Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling.</p>\n<p>If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value, though that is left in the hands of the GM.</p>\n<h4>Lowering the Price</h4>\n<p>If you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price. Each time you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a buyer increases by one step.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell. As it’s an Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the street. The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth), so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bartering</h3>\n<p>Rural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one commodity for another without exchanging money. To resolve bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being traded against those being acquired. The barter ratio indicates how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the other commodity are acquired. ‘Units’ are defined by checking the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into packages of roughly equivalent value.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Bartering Ratios</h3>\n<table style=\"width:460px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\"><strong>Traded Items</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">Scare</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">Exotic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">4:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">8:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Scarce</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">4:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">2:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Exotic</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:8</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"x7ZXvJZVij1U9hlU","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":500001}}}

{"_id":"lUQ9AtwL7HurNHo7","name":"Motivations","content":"<p>A Character’s Motivation represents — in a word or short phrase — what they care about most in the world, and what drives them to achieve their Ambitions. In a sense, it’s one of the most important things about a Character, because it tells us why they do what they do! In light of that monumental importance, we’ve compiled a few tools to help GMs and Players alike in choosing and managing their Motivations.</p>\n<h3>Choosing Motivations</h3>\n<p>Choosing Motivations can seem tricky — after all, they’re so important! But it doesn’t have to be a difficult process, especially if you follow these tips, and review the example Motivations presentated below.</p>\n<p>It’s worth stressing that the most interesting Characters are those whose Motivations run contrary to what you would normally expect. Everyone expects a mercenary to care about ‘Wealth’, but what if they actually care about ‘Duty’ to their family, and are sending all their money back home? Everyone expects a Scholar to care about ‘Knowledge’, but what if they are motivated more by ‘Romance’ than anything else? A good rule of thumb when it comes to writing is to throw out your first idea because it’s the obvious one, and the same often applies to a Character’s Motivation.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that your Motivation isn’t locked in stone, it can change whenever you need it to.</p>\n<h3>Changing Motivations</h3>\n<p>A Character’s Motivations are sure to change throughout the course of their adventuring life, and Players and GMs should always be vigilant for when this occurs. Whilst Motivation can be changed at the beginning of every session, it’s a good idea to save these changes for the following moments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you find yourself having not played to your Character’s Motivation in a few sessions</li>\n<li>When you change Career</li>\n<li>When you complete an Ambition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players should use these events to express how their Character has changed, and are encouraged to show off their new Motivation in the coming session. You should award an additional Resolve Point if this change is roleplayed in a believable and dramatic fashion!</p>\n<h3>The 'Check-In'</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, during an intense scene or Combat, it’s difficult to keep track of Motivations, and whether or not they trigger @JournalEntry[01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl]{Resolve}. If you’re finding your group forgets about Motivation often, or if you’d rather not worry about it during a session, try using a Check-In instead.</p>\n<p>A Check-In occurs at the same time as handing out XP, and involves everyone going around the table and announcing their Motivation. Next, everyone considers the session they’ve just played, and decides if that Character expressed their Motivation ‘not at all’, ‘a bit’ or ‘a lot’. Everyone should get a say, and should take this opportunity to point out interesting and humorous moments during the session, but ultimately the Player and the GM together have the final say over how much the Motivation was expressed. This is purely subjective, so go more along how it felt, rather than a point-for-point retelling of the session.</p>\n<p>If a Character expressed their Motivation ‘not at all’, they regain no Resolve. If they expressed it ‘a bit’, they regain 1 Resolve Point, or 2 Resolve for ‘a lot’.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Ruinous Motivations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some Motivations are, themselves, the pathways of the damned. Whilst some are clearly corrupting like ‘Debauchery’ or ‘Violence’, even seemingly innocent Motivations can and do stoke the fire of Chaos within a Character. ‘Change’ and ‘Hope’ are admirable Motivations, though they do undeniably play into the machinations of Tzeentch and Nurgle respectively.</em></p>\n<p><em>You may offer a Player an additional Resolve Point for following the Character’s Motivation in exchange for a Corruption Point if the action appears to aid one or more of the Ruinous Powers. This choice is always the Player’s to make.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Example Motivations</h3>\n<p>The following is a list of example Motivations accompanied by situations which might earn them Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Authority</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a clear chain of command, and thrive when there are orders to be followed — whether you’re giving them, or taking them. Most people who favour such structure either long for the day when they themselves are able to pass commands down the chain to their lessers, or believe themselves to be merely a cog in a greater machine. Following orders or listening to, and assisting, the authorities garners Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Change</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need for change, for a better or brighter future. You are discontent with the status quo, and any action you take that shifts this — whether positively or negatively — is better than what we have now, at least. Anything you do that is counter to the norm feeds into this Motivation.</p>\n<h4>Charity</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to help people. Whilst many give to charity in pursuit of power, status, or out of boredom, you do it for its own sake. Charity, in your eyes, is its own reward. Helping the less fortunate, and giving what you can, regenerates your Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Control</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a desire to control the world around you. Perhaps you suffer from anxiety, or were raised in a situation where you were the centre of attention — whatever the reason, you thrive when there are no surprises. You regain Resolve when you seek to bend the world around you to your will.</p>\n<h4>Debauchery</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by forbidden delights. Either the fact that they are forbidden is tantilising to you, or you’ve lost sight of healthy appetites long ago, you regain Resolve when you give into your obscene desires.</p>\n<h4>Envy</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to possess that which others have. It could be anything — wealth, romance, land, power — but you desire these things because someone else has them, not for their own merit. When you covet and take from others, you are sure to regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Faith (God)</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a deep faith in your patron God of choice, and allow the strictures of such to dictate your life. Choose a God to go along with this Motivation, and regain Resolve whenever you go out of your way to follow that God’s strictures, or protect the honour and sanctity of their worship. A list of Gods and their strictures can be found in @JournalEntry[G6Y8TD1355K5pVvl]{The Gods}</p>\n<h4>Fame</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by being known. You want your name to be on everyone’s lips, to be well regarded, and to be remembered. When you perform actions in public, or work to spread word of your deeds (real or imaginary), you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Freedom</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by being untethered and allowed to go where you please. Often freed bondsmen, enslaved individuals, or the children of overly oppressive parents burn with this Motivation. You recover Resolve when you choose your own path in the face of authority.</p>\n<h4>Glory</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to achieve great things. You likely have one burning desire — perhaps your Long Term Ambition — which, whenever you work towards it, you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Gluttony</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by an unnatural appetite for something specific, and wish to indulge that vice at all times. When you pursue or partake of your vice, you feed your Motivation and regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Hope</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a hope that things can get better. In the Old World, this is a futile Motivation, but it doesn’t stop thousands of souls trudging towards it every day. When you perform actions that seem doomed to fail, but you do them anyway because you believe it might work out, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Infamy</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a desire to be remembered and feared. Like fame, infamy is about developing a personal story that will always be bigger than the person you were, but it differs in that you don’t want to be remembered kindly. You want to forever serve as a lesson to someone or against something, and whenever you strike fear, or encourage rumours about yourself, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Justice</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to see justice done. Whether it’s a belief that justice holds together society, or a perverse fascination with punishment, you see enacting the law of the Gods — though not necessarily the law of the land — as paramount. Whenever you aid or enact your own justice, regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Knowledge</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the search for knowledge itself. You don’t necessarily want to do anything with that knowledge, but the pursuit is what’s important to you. When you learn something new, or encourage the spread of knowledge, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Love</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a strong bond of love with someone. Love is often irrational, and causes people to act in ways which deprioritise their own safety or happiness, and doing so is a sure way of earning Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Obligation</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by an obligation you hold — to family, friends, an organisation, and so on. You likely have a role to play in relation to this obligation, and fulfilling that role is of paramount importance to you. Whenever you perform actions that fulfill that role, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Order</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by structure and order. You thrive when there is a set framework to operate inside of, and rules to follow. You regain Resolve when you follow the rules — especially to your detriment — and help enforce them.</p>\n<h4>Patriotism</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by love of country. This pride can become toxic — used as a pathetic crutch to cover for your own failings — or could stem from true pride in the history of your people — whether deserved or doctored. You recover Resolve by putting your nation first, and by following the dictates of your rulers — rational or otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Perfection</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to be perfect. Regardless of what the focus is, you need to be the perfect example of it, a painter, a poet, a cook, whatever. This Motivation exists beyond any tangible benefits of that perfection or profession, and often strays into a truly unhealthy mindset, for perfection is ultimately impossible. Whenever you work towards that perfection, regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Pleasure</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure, fine food, fine wine, fine friends, and so forth. You seek to get the most out of life, and feel fulfilled when in good, comfortable, pleasurable company. You regain Resolve whenever you take a little extra effort to bring a little extra pleasure into your life.</p>\n<h4>Power</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a quest for power. It doesn’t matter what power, and over whom, but you feel safer and more whole when the power of any situation is in your hands. This may translate into literal power — the search for arcane potency or martial excellence — but not necessarily. You just have to exert and extend your reach to recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Respect</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the respect of your peers. It’s not necessarily about being the best — the best swordsman, the best incantor, the best alchemist — but you need your peers to heed what you say, and admire your works. You may see yourself as </p>\n<p>first among equals, or merely rising to the level of your heroes, but either way, when you increase or maintain your standing, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Revenge</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need for revenge. Perhaps someone killed your father and they must prepare to die, or someone ruined your family’s business and now you seek to destroy theirs. Whatever the source of your ire, you seek to reenact it on those who hurt you. Whenever you work towards or fulfill your revenge, recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Ruin</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the ruination of the world around you. You may have a target in mind, a specific nation, family, or organisation, or merely existence itself. Whenever you work to bring your foes to their knees and have them crushed under your boot, you regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Servitude</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by your service to another. Servitude is a rare Motivation, because it relies on the mind placing the needs of another above one’s own, and trusting in the benevolence of that master. When you act at the behest of those you serve, you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Survival</h4>\n<p>You are motivated first and foremost by your own survival, and will do what you can to protect yourself. This Motivation extends to protecting your livelihood, if it comes under existential threat — a hunter defending their hunting grounds from poachers, or an urchin protecting their streets from invading troops. In any situation where you take an active hand to maintain your survival, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Unity</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by uniting others towards a common goal. Whether this stems from dreams of Empire, Shallyan pacifism, or a desire to mend an old feud, you regain Resolve when you act to bring others together.</p>\n<h4>Wealth</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the clink of coins. Whilst almost everyone is motivated in some way by money in the Old World, you desire money for its own sake. You may even be loath to spend it once it is yours. Wealth, for you, doesn’t necessarily mean power or privilege, but it represents a dependable source of strength for yourself. Whenever you seek out wealth and hoard it, regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Violence</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by violence, and love the thrill of battle. You might be addicted to the adrenaline, or you’re fascinated by the craft of battle. Whatever the case, whenever you engage in violent acts for their own purpose, regenerate Resolve.</p>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":400001}}}
{"_id":"lcuASXH4nzT5Ipqr","name":"NPCs With Character","content":"<p>More than any other aspect of <strong>WFRP</strong>, your creation and enacting of memorable NPCs is what will bring the Old World to life. Unforgettable NPCs help create the impetus to roleplay and cause Players to become invested in what happens to them, and by extension, their own Characters. Not every NPC needs to be a tour de force of personality, but a few ‘shining stars’ go a long way towards filling the firmament with light – or darkness, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>Every NPC you introduce into an adventure should be there for a purpose, which can vary wildly from ‘background scenery’ to ‘biggest bad-guy’ and everything in-between. Some you may place specifically because they can assist the characters or spur them onward by offering something valuable, e.g. knowledge, training, equipment – in exchange for something the Characters can offer them, e.g. investigative skill, money, directed violence. Others serve as potential antagonists or definite enemies, and consider having a few just because they’re fun for you to play and your Players to enjoy.</p>\n<p>The following are the building blocks of an unforgettable NPC. You don’t have to put as much detail into an NPC destined to be a ‘prop’, but that said, remain flexible. With practice, you may find that you create even minor NPCs memorable enough that your Players will occasionally promptly latch onto one, and even though you originally intended them to be nothing more than a bit of background flavour, they’ll soon be dragged into the Characters’ adventures. Fortunately, <strong>WFRP </strong>has a designator for such folks – they make <em>excellent </em>Henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>A Name</strong> – A decent name will do, but a really good name will stick in the mind. It will likely help you to create a small list of names in advance, checking them off as they get used. That way, if you have to come up with a name ‘on the fly’ when the Characters insist on learning all about the innocuous barkeep, you won’t have to fumble for one. Keep in mind that other points from later in this list may well be referred to in an NPC’s name, especially if they are rare. There are a lot of forgettable ‘Karls’ in the Empire, but ‘Crimson Karl’ the gent that’s eternally bright beet-red in the face from yelling? He’ll stick out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>Use the `/name` command to generate a name! <br />e.g. `/name human male` `/name welf male` `/name helf female`</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Appearance </strong>– What does the NPC look like? Some folks think they need to put a lot of detail into this, but really, too many details and your Players will just lose track, especially if you have a lot of NPCs. Always note species, but then, try to stick to, at the very most, two or three solid details that stand out. </p>\n<p>Height, weight, eye colour, and so forth, only need to be noted if they are unusual. Scars, odd tattoos, eccentric clothing choices, weird trappings, the fact they always carry a bedraggled cat with a tiny peg leg – these are the things people notice and Players remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms </strong>– This is a big category, for it covers style of speech, personality traits, unusual quirks of behaviour, and how the NPC regularly deals with other folk. When determining how an NPC regularly acts, be wary of regularly using stereotypes – not every Dwarf is grumpy and short-tempered, but that said, there is a reason for that stereotype. A general note for an NPCs outward behaviour will often suffice. Are they friendly, taciturn, impatient, hostile?</p>\n<p>Think about what the NPC’s voice sounds like. Especially if their voice sounds nothing like yours, it is okay to tell your Players what the NPCs voice may remind them of. If you want to do a different accent for a specific NPC and feel comfortable doing so, awesome, but be wary of giving strange voices to many NPCs, especially if they hurt your throat to do them. Instead, try playing with your vocabulary, speak in short sentences, using small words for a slow-witted Ogre; speak swiftly, on the edge of breathlessness, for a flighty Halfling.</p>\n<p>A quick search of the internet will yield more lists of example personality traits and quirks of behaviour than you can sic a small but vicious dog on. There are, in fact, whole websites dedicated to such and they can serve as inspiration, but be sure to consider how your Players, and their Characters, will react to certain traits – they are unlikely to want to deal a lot with someone really annoying (which, honestly, might be fun for you if they have to, for a time).</p>\n<p><strong>Career</strong> – What the NPC ostensibly does for a living. Most folk in the Old World are completely tied to their Class and Career and can generally afford to do very little outside of them, unless they are of a higher status with enough wealth to let them ‘indulge’ in different pastimes. Many NPCs may well have had a different Career at one point, but only a few rare ones will have ever jumped between different Classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Unusual Qualities</strong> – This is a catch-all for traits others wouldn’t suspect in the NPC. Particularly high levels of skill, Talents from outside their Career, strange knowledge, Traits from the Bestiary, and so on. Most NPCs should only have one or two Unusual Qualities at most, if any. Note that ‘mutations’ generally fall under ‘Problems’.</p>\n<p><strong>Drives </strong>- Whole plots are driven by these most basic questions: What does the NPC want? What are they prepared to do to get it? Like Characters, important NPCs should have ambitions, though not every ambition has to be realistic. A low-born NPC may aspire to be a Baron one day. This is naught but a weirdroot dream for most folk, but society is changing in the Empire, and a driven merchant, or perhaps a crime lord, with the right connections might just achieve such a lofty goal. Your Characters will certainly have wanted to help such an individual along their way, or perhaps, did everything they could to stop them…</p>\n<p><strong>Problems </strong>– Finally, any NPC you know will interact with the Characters should have a problem or two that the Characters might be able to help them with, or take advantage of, which may, or may not, tie into their ambitions. Try to think of problems with multiple potential solutions, e.g. an NPC that has something the Characters desperately want, desires to advance in their Trade Guild, but feels trapped and doesn’t know how to. Depending on the Characters’ skill sets, they could spread gossip about the superior nature of the NPC’s wares, sabotage or kill their competition, bribe their superiors, etc. Some problems should actually be ‘secrets’ which may, or may not, have an actual solution, e.g. hidden mutations, holding to a forbidden faith, an unrequited love, etc. Most such problems can’t be ‘solved’, but they’re ripe for blackmail.</p>\n<h2>Sample NPCs</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter Käsegeier, Cheesemonger Extraordinaire}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Rs3lMA5UavTlTiJW]{Kastor Erichson, Jumpy Hunter}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.nRJxtciIhTHKqAvY]{Stellemar, Loyal Hound}</strong></p>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":500001}}}

She is generally depicted as a tall, classically beautiful woman, and usually carries a sword and a set of scales. As the patron of justice she is concerned with fairness rather than the letter of the law: she opposes tyranny and oppression as much as crime.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Verena is worshipped throughout the Old World, especially in the south. Her devout followers include scholars, lawyers, and magistrates, as well as some wizards of the Colleges of Magic, particularly of the Grey and Light orders.</p>\n<p>The cult of Verena has no rigid hierarchy: it is said that Verena alone heads the cult, and no mortal intermediary is needed because truth is self-evident and requires no interpretation. Temple priests from the Order of Lorekeepers are tasked to preserve knowledge and communicate it to the community. They keep up a voluminous correspondence with each other, exchanging information and news. </p>\n<p>Priests from the equally influential Order of Scalebearers are much sought after to act as judges, arbitrators, and go-betweens, because of their famed impartiality and mastery of the law. The Order of Mysteries is much smaller and less well-known, and contains warrior-priests who seek lost and forgotten lore, wherever it may lie. The last major order is the Knights of the Everlasting Light, templars famed for their sword skills, sense of fairness, and legendary bad luck. Verena’s cultists usually wear plain white robes, symbolic of pure truth and impartiality.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Temples to Verena can be found in most cities and larger towns, generally situated in the administrative or university quarters. Most libraries and court-houses include a shrine to the goddess, and smaller shrines can be found in the homes of many scholars and lawyers. Temples usually have colonnaded facades, with symbols of the goddess and allegorical figures of learning presented in low relief. Inside is a large statue of Verena, normally seated with a book in her lap, a pair of scales in her left hand, and her right hand resting on the hilt of a sword. Smaller rooms lead off from the main temple, including a library and chambers for the attendant priests. Each temple has at least one meeting room where negotiations can take place under the eyes of the goddess.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Verena normally involve the recovery or preservation of knowledge, the righting of an injustice, or the resolution of a dispute. Cultists may also be sent to recover a long-forgotten book of lore, or to mediate in a difficult quarrel. This could be anything from a farmers’ boundary dispute to unpicking the complicated politics of two realms on the brink of war.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Strictures</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Never refuse to arbitrate a dispute when asked.</em></li>\n<li><em>Always tell the truth without fear or favour.</em></li>\n<li><em>Protect knowledge at all costs.</em></li>\n<li><em>Combat must be a last resort when all alternative routes are fruitless.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never become a tool of injustice or heresy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FRkIz2sR7ZC92W2G]{Blessing of Wisdom}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tMocig1z9dHKNiCT]{Blessing of Wit}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.jXyyzYWid3nruQmc]{As Verena is My Witness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.R6Q16WOXcPfaHnOb]{Blind Justice}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.oI3iwxVEXHRLSael]{Shackles of Truth}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.o5soyuEJoUk9HmCC]{Sword of Justice}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.DA4ZB3HkOh51vhuB]{Truth Will Out}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.fAlQcNUb6TZtPKqk]{Wisdom of the Owl}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/verena.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":1200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":1200001}}}

He sends divine ravens to guide dead souls to the Portal, the pillared gateway between the mortal realms and the realm of the gods. He then leads each soul from there to its final resting place: either Morr’s Underworld, or the afterlife of another god. He is commonly portrayed as a tall, dark-haired man of aristocratic bearing, with a brooding, intense air. </p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Outside Ostermark, where Morr has special importance, few wish to attract the God of Death’s attention, so normally only the bereaved pray to him. However, those desperate or brave enough may pray for dreams of what the future may bring, though it is said he rarely divulges anything not associated with dying.</p>\n<p>The Order of the Shroud dominates the cult, directly controlling all other orders and the Mourners’ Guild, those responsible for overseeing burials and burial grounds. Supporting them, the Black Guard are the cult’s largest templar order, tasked to guard temples and hunt down the Undead. The Order of Augurs may be small, but it guides the leadership </p>\n<p>with its foretellings, and organises the Order of Doomsayers: these wandering priests of Morr tour the land performing Doomings for all Human children on their tenth year. Bringing them all together, every decade a grand convocation of the priesthood of Morr is held at Luccini in Tilea, where the future for the cult is discussed around city-wide festivities.</p>\n<p>All Morr’s clerics wear plain, black, hooded robes without adornment or trimming.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Temples of Morr are within Gardens of Morr: great graveyards wrapped with black roses that bloom all year, and are rarely used for anything other than funeral services. Most are plain structures of dark stone, distinguished by a broad doorway with a heavy lintel-stone — representing Morr’s Portal. The doors are always open, like the doors to the Kingdom of Death.  Inside, the temples are bare. Any necessary furniture and other equipment is kept in storage until it is needed for a funeral service. Shrines to Morr also take the form of a gateway, usually consisting of two plain pillars and a lintel. In some cases, one pillar is white marble and the other black basalt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Morr’s penances typically involve hunting Necromancers and destroying Undead, or finding and restoring burial places and holy sites fallen to disuse and disrepair. He also occasionally requires servants of Khaine be stopped from fulfilling their dark deeds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Respect and protect the dead.</em></li>\n<li><em>Hunt down Necromancers and the Undead wherever they may gather.</em></li>\n<li><em>Pay heed to your dreams.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never refuse to conduct a funeral service.</em></li>\n<li><em>At no time be a party to raising the dead, unless allowed by Morr.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessing</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FRkIz2sR7ZC92W2G]{Blessing of Wisdom}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0AQheUiRtffqfKNg]{Death Mask}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.sdSy4k7ygDhAjSSX]{Destroy Undead}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.itARFNqBAbwNDAAy]{Dooming}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rbdxcYoj8N2eMaqV]{Last Rites}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.uE6AXjMjYvtvXQvy]{Portal's Threshold}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SjKFVBXgLC51dnQz]{Stay Morr's Hand}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/morr.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":400001}}}

However, in the sun-drenched south, Myrmidia is much more than this: she acts as the patron deity of both the Estalian Kingdoms and the Tilean City States, and is fanatically worshipped in both realms. Because of this, her cult is the largest in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire. She is commonly portrayed as a tall, muscular, young woman armed and equipped in archaic, southern stylings. She is known for her calm, honourable approach to all matters, and her clerics do what they can to emulate this.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Myrmidia grants generals the insight to win battles with minimal losses, and soldiers the skill-at-arms to defeat enemies quickly and without significant losses. Because of this, her cult is steadily growing among the armies and garrisons of the Empire, especially in the Reikland, Averland, and Wissenland. In the Empire, the cult has three orders of significance. The Order of the Eagle tends to the temples and their surrounding communities, and is led from Nuln by the ‘Eagle of the North’, the most powerful Myrmidian north of the Vaults. The templar Order of the Righteous Spear has a chapterhouse attached to each of these temples, each commanded by the local high priest. A second templar order, the Order of the Blazing Sun, is the oldest Myrmidian order in the Empire, and works independently of the Order of the Eagle.</p>\n<p>Myrmidia’s clerics in the Empire normally wear blue cowls over white robes with red edging, with her symbol either sewn onto the left breast or worn as a cloak-clasp.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Most of Myrmidia’s holy sites are found in Estalia and Tilea, and are associated with the goddess’s campaigns across those realms when she manifested as a mortal over two-thousand years ago. In the Empire, the goddess has much less of a presence, with temples only in major towns and cities, and only a single monastic order cloistered in the Monastery of the Black Maiden in Wissenland. Temples to Myrmidia tend to follow the architectural styles of Tilea and Estalia, with domed roofs covering square or rectangular halls. Their exteriors are often carved with low reliefs showing battle scenes or tableaux of weapons and shields. Shrines may take the form of miniature temples, statues of the goddess, or free-standing sculptures of stacked weapons, shields, and armour. Myrmidia’s holy sites are also known for their scandalous depictions of the goddess and her saints, who are often presented wearing little more than scarves about their waists, which many Sigmarites find completely unacceptable.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances from Myrmidia are usually military in nature. A cultist may be ordered to defeat an enemy champion in single combat, or to train a group of peasants and lead them in the defence of their village. Protecting pilgrimage routes to sites of importance to Myrmidia are also not uncommon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Act with honour and dignity in all matters.</em></li>\n<li><em>Respect prisoners of war, and never kill an enemy who surrenders</em></li>\n<li><em>Show no mercy to the unrepentant enemies of Humanity.</em></li>\n<li><em>Obey all honourable orders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Preserve the weak from the horrors of war.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Q91bWCEn0gt33fGT]{Blazing Sun}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.7KUKKbXBv8MbyEHt]{Eagle's Eye}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.nyZNUwJ54MTLKQ7Y]{Fury's Call}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ezVl3vFWTwHfNXL3]{Inspiring}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.V8GCeqgk1FNGFg76]{Shield of Myrmidia}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.BVZWihaal1zq3aJs]{Spear of Myrmidia}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/myrmidia.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":500001}}}

Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed. A successful Evaluate Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically by inspecting coins for weight and hardness.</p>\n<p>Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder. It requires an Art (Engraving) Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then a Trade (Blacksmith) Test to strike the coins, usually with the aid of an assistant. Including a higher precious metal content makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins.</p>\n<h4>Clipping</h4>\n<p>Embezzlers can trim slivers of precious metal away from the edges of coins. This scam is called ‘clipping’ or ‘shaving’ and is practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access to large quantities of other peoples’ money. Gold and silver filings are then melted down and sold to jewellers, counterfeiters, or fences. Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Nuln Standard</em></h3>\n<p><em>Altdorf may be the current capital of Reikland and the Empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state of Nuln to the south.

{"_id":"rbYdtt30R3CXeDJI","name":"Halflings","content":"<p>Halflings are ubiquitous across the Reikland, found working in service industries in all towns, with an entire district of Reikland’s capital of Altdorf, known as Haffenstadt, packed tight with hundreds of extended Halfling families supporting restaurants, taverns, pipeweed stores, and an enormous number of street-food hawkers. Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland’s villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space.</p>\n<p>Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage, and many Halfling clans can trace their ancestry back many centuries to the very founding of the Mootland (their self-governed Grand Province in the Empire). The Elder of the Moot — currently Hisme Stoutheart — is the custodian of the <em>Haffenlyver</em> , an ancient embroidered scroll detailing the chief bloodlines of their primary clans, said to be the greatest treasure of the Halflings. </p>\n<p>Another peculiar detail is the Halflings’ strange affinity for Ogres. Despite their ravenous appetites, and penchant for eating whatever is at hand, Ogres tend to respect Halflings. Indeed, gangs of Ogre labourers are often overseen by Halfling gaffers, and most Ogre mercenary bands have a Halfling cook on staff.</p>\n<p>Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children, and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this impression. They are known for their enormous appetites in all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they’re huggers), social boundaries (‘Well me’ great aunt’s just shacked up with me best mate, and you should hear what they’ve been up to!’), and property rights (‘It’s not like he’s using it!’); this last has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery. </p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans…</h4>\n<p><em>‘Stiff-necked and pious, warlike and jealous… I could go on, but good manners halts me, and, besides, I like them, and they like me pies.

In this section, we’re going to help you avoid these pitfalls.</p>\n<h3>Survival At A Cost</h3>\n<p>Whilst death should remain a real and present threat to Characters in<strong> WFRP</strong>, it is so unfortunately final. A Character’s death is the end of their story, and as such, is a source of drama only for those who survive. This is fine, but not as effective as the alternative: survival at a cost.</p>\n<p>GMs and Players alike should consider all of the tools available to prevent death whilst steering the story into new and challenging directions. Scars, permanent injuries and amputations, changing and traumatic @JournalEntry[4cRhTRnXFqMf90Bs]{Psychologies}, and @JournalEntry[u7IJ1xm4pO5s9QgS]{Dark Deals} are all examples of evocative, Character-changing, and story-enhancing experiences. A Duellist who loses their primary arm to a stray cannonball and must now find a new way in the world is infinitely more interesting than a Duellist buried in the ground.</p>\n<h3>Embracing Character Death</h3>\n<p>There are a few instances where Character death is the most interesting thing that could happen to them. These moments should come with buy-in from the Player controlling that Character. In this case, a Player should feel empowered, if they so wish, to ignore their Fate Points, and accept that their Character’s story has come to an end. The three most obvious examples are: self-sacrifice, prophetic, and no-way-out deaths.</p>\n<h4>Self-sacrifice Deaths</h4>\n<p>When a Character has the chance to save the life of a friend by sacrificing their own, it is a pivotal moment in a Campaign. This is particularly effective if the bond between the Characters has been given emotional weight throughout the Campaign, as it represents an act that cannot be taken back. However, this is not recommended if the controlling Player still has stories they wish to tell with their Character.</p>\n<h4>Prophetic Deaths</h4>\n<p>Prophecies are everywhere in Warhammer, from the Doomings every Imperial child has delivered to them, to those whispered by seers and wizards the Old World over. If a Character is presented with a perfect moment to fulfill a prophecy which would result in them dying, it could be more thematically impactful if the Player accepts this fate. However, prophecies that prove to be wrong right at the last moment can also be sources of dramatic tension, so this can really go either way.</p>\n<h4>No-way-out Deaths</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the situation is so dire that you can’t imagine a way out. Whether your neck is on the chopping block, or a Slaaneshi cultist has a wicked blade to your throat, sometimes it’s better to accept that a Character made some wrong turns along the road of life. Often these sorts of deaths serve to tell a moral — don’t fight the law because the law will win, or don’t get into bed with the servants of She Who Thirsts. However, sometimes those morals need to be flipped on their heads to hammer home the theme — the law is corrupt and deserves to be fought! Don’t use this if you feel backed into a corner, but rather if you feel the death would be satisfying to the story. Even if there seems to be no way out, a spent Fate Point demands unusual and even impossible circumstances arising to save a Character.</p>\n<p>None of these methods work unless a Player wants them to, and ultimately, the decision is in their hands. There is a good reason why Characters have Fate Points to spend!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Heroic Death</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characters who witness a heroic death, such as through self-sacrifice, are changed forever and that memory works to embolden their spirits in times of greater peril. When a Character encounters a situation similar to the heroic death, they gain a +20 bonus to Psychology Tests as they recall the heroic deed.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Daenar, seeing the inevitability of the on-coming Greenskin charge, and the perilous situation her companions are in, decides to hold them back long enough for the rest of her party to cross a rope bridge, cut it loose, and escape. Daenar stands her ground, draws her bow, and shouts at her companions to run. Months later, surrounded by Greenskins once more, Nils, Ezra, and Adelheidi recall the bravery of their fallen comrade, and are encouraged to press on because of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Introducing New Characters</h3>\n<p>When a Character dies, either heroically or hilariously, introducing the Player’s new Character to the existing party can be difficult, especially in the middle of an adventure. Here are a few tactics you can use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hired help</strong>. The party, recognising they’re missing an important piece, goes looking for someone to fill that niche. It just so happens the right (or perhaps only) person for the job is the new Character.</li>\n<li><strong>A friend in need</strong>. A beloved NPC is brought forward and becomes a full Character. If you need that Character to fulfill additional roles in the current adventure, either substitute in a different NPC for that role, or tell that Player what functions they need them to serve, and trust them to bring their own little twist.</li>\n<li><strong>We’re all in this together</strong>. If the Characters find themselves in a perilous situation — imprisoned or enslaved by their enemies, or running through the forest fleeing from whatever killed their friend — it’s easy to put bystanders or other adventuring types in the same situation. Nothing builds unity quite like a shared enemy, after all.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcements</strong>. If the Characters have a patron or an organisation who have employed them for their current mission, that employer can send along some needed reinforcements to get the job done.</li>\n<li><strong>Wait until the next adventure</strong>. Sometimes there’s no good way to jump straight into a new Character. If the next adventure isn’t far off — perhaps the next session — some Players may enjoy the chance to become a co-GM and take control of the Creatures the Characters fight, or to portray some of the cast of NPCs. This kind of change can even be seen as a consolation prize, or reward of sorts for losing a Character.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Doomings With 0 Fate</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Doomed Talent really takes centre stage when a Character falls to 0 Fate Points, because it’s no longer merely a string of words, but a prophecy which should terrify every Imperial soul. When this happens, you are encouraged to take that Character’s Dooming and attempt to manifest it in the world as much as possible, through both poetic and literal means. Not only does this increase the chances of a Character dying in a manner that matches their Dooming, and therefore increasing thematic cohesion in the story, but it also serves to spotlight that Character, and drive home the dread that is ever present in the Old World.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Nils has the Dooming ‘A kiss shall end thy days,’ and has recently fallen to 0 Fate Points after a nasty encounter with a hook-handed pirate. The GM takes this opportunity to have Marina, a revolutionary that Nils has been spending a lot of time with, grow increasingly emboldened. When the two of them light the fuse on a bomb set to blow up a shrine to the Chaos God Nurgle, Marina — fearing her life is about to be cut short — kisses Nils on the lips. Nils is now terrified even more so than he was already, and has to deal with this new awkwardness… if he doesn’t explode into little gobbets first.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Interpreting A Dooming</span></h3>\n<p><em>Perhaps the greatest thing about a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Dooming} is how very vague they’re worded despite how very important they are. These simple fragments of ‘wisdom’ are intended to guide a person’s whole life, as they spell out the moment of one’s death! Furthermore, there exists a great taboo in sharing one’s Dooming with another, so what may seem natural to one person would be inexplicably odd to another.</em></p>\n<p><em>Players and Characters should feel free to interpret their Dooming in whatever way they see fit, and should be encouraged to express that interpretation in hilarious ways. For example a Character with the Dooming ‘Trust not the innocence of children, for their plans are far from sound,’ may have an inherent aversion to children, or may feel a strong need to ignore and counteract anything a child says to them. They may take the Dooming literally, and believe that if their plans are ‘far from sound’, then plans involving sounds and noises are inherently trustworthy. Or potentially, if they can’t trust innocent children, maybe they can only trust guilty children, so they encourage the children they know to commit crimes!</em></p>\n<p><em>Remember that the majority of people in the Old World are both superstitious and very very skeptical, which makes for some ridiculous interpretations. Make sure to breathe some truth into their interpretations, but also to exploit other curious (and equally ridiculous) twists of your own.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"tYPTR2b0p6Xubk7d","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide","sort":300001}}}
{"_id":"ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO","name":"Weapons","content":"<p>Weapons used across the Empire vary according to provincial preference, religious requirement, individual inclination, and trusty old tradition. Here you will find a selection of the most commonly wielded melee and ranged weapons, which are presented using the following format.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weapon Group</strong>: Each Weapon is listed by its Weapon Group. If a weapon is two-handed, it is marked (2H)</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: The price for an average example of the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Enc</strong>: The Encumbrance for the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Availability</strong>: The Availability of the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Reach/Range</strong>: The Weapon’s length, or the range of the weapon in yards.</li>\n<li><strong>Damage</strong>: The weapon’s Damage, which is added to your SL to hit.</li>\n<li><strong>Qualities and Flaw</strong>s: Any Weapon Qualities or Flaws the weapon possesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strength Bonus is abbreviated to SB in the weapon tables.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[BL1bpxy0ms0dEgzK]{Melee Weapons}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[zOGP7JwZ3gqQa6Qj]{Ranged Weapons}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[jX9O4T79T7r01dkc]{Ammunition}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Hand Weapons</span></h3>\n<p><em>‘Hand Weapon’ is used to describe any of a number of basic weapons that, though different, are assumed to be effectively the same in-game, including swords, axes, hammers, maces, short spears, and more.</em></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Blackpowder Ammunition</span></h3>\n<p><em>Blunderbusses are the only weapons listed that use the Small Shot or Improvised Shot ammunition. All other Blackpowder and Engineering weapons use bullets.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Weapon Damage</h3>\n<p>Some @Table[oops]{Fumble results} or spells may damage your weapon. For each point of damage your weapon receives, reduce its Damage by –1. If the Damage is reduced to +0 (or SB +0), the weapon is mangled beyond all recognition, and now counts as an Improvised Weapon. If an Improvised Weapon is Damaged, it is considered useless for melee combat.</p>\n<p>Weapons can be fixed by appropriate Artisans for 10% of the weapon’s cost per damage point sustained. Weapons reduced to Improvised Weapons cannot be fixed. You can also repair your own weapons if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, Trade Tools and, for more than a single point of Damage, a Workshop.</p>\n<h3>Melee Weapon Groups</h3>\n<p>All melee weapons are assigned to a Weapon Group. Each Weapon Group requires a separate skill to master its use.  So, Melee (Flail) allows you to use Flails and is a separate skill from Melee (Polearm), which allows you to use Polearms. If you use a weapon from a Group where you have no Advances, you Test your Weapon Skill to hit with the weapon. While you still suffer all the weapon’s Flaws, you cannot use any of its Qualities. Some Melee Weapon Groups also have special rules.</p>\n<h4>Cavalry</h4>\n<p>Cavalry weapons are assumed to be used when mounted. When not used from horse-back, all two-handed weapons in the Cavalry Weapon Group also count as Two-Handed weapons. Single-handed Cavalry weapons are not normally used when unmounted.</p>\n<h4>Flail</h4>\n<p>Unskilled characters add the Dangerous Weapon Flaw to their Flails, and the other listed Weapon Qualities are not used.</p>\n<h4>Parry</h4>\n<p>Any one-handed weapon with the Defensive Quality can be used with Melee (Parry). When using Melee (Parry), a weapon can be used to Oppose an incoming attack without the normal –20 off-hand penalty (see @JournalEntry[NYFfUIbUfYA3tbj8]{Two-Weapon Fighting}).</p>\n<h3>Weapon Reach</h3>\n<p>The lengths of the weapons are progressively bigger as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personal</strong>: Your legs and fists, perhaps your head, and anything attached to those.</li>\n<li><strong>Very Short</strong>: Less than a foot in length.</li>\n<li><strong>Short</strong>: Up to 2 feet in length.</li>\n<li><strong>Average</strong>: Up to 3 feet long.</li>\n<li><strong>Long</strong>: Up to 6 foot long.</li>\n<li><strong>Very Long</strong>: Up to 10 feet in length; can Engage enemies up to 4 yards away, rather than just 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Massive</strong>: Anything over 10 feet long; can Engage enemies up to 6 yards away, rather than just 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Weapon Length and In-Fighting</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">These are simple rules for those who like to use Weapon length for more than simple description of appearance, and a possible impediment to fitting down dark tunnels.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Weapon Length</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If your weapon is longer than your opponents’, they suffer a penalty of –10 to hit you as you find it easier to keep them at bay.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">In-Fighting</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">As your Action, you can perform an Opposed Melee Test to attempt to step inside your opponent’s weapon length. The winner chooses if combat continues as normal or as ‘in-fighting’. During in-fighting, any weapon longer than Short counts as an Improvised weapon.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Ranged Weapon Groups</h3>\n<p>Ranged weapons are difficult to master. You cannot attempt a Ranged Test for a weapon you do not have the correct speciality for. So, if you know Ranged (Blackpowder), you cannot attempt a Ranged (Bow) Test. However, there are a few exceptions.</p>\n<h4>Blackpowder and Explosives</h4>\n<p>Those with Ranged (Engineering) can use Blackpowder and Explosive weapons without penalty.</p>\n<h4>Crossbows and Throwing</h4>\n<p>Crossbows and Thrown weapons are relatively simple to use. You can attempt a Ranged (Crossbow) or Ranged (Throwing) Test using your Ballistic Skill, but the weapon loses all Qualities whilst retaining its Flaws.</p>\n<h4>Engineering</h4>\n<p>All Engineering weapons can be used by characters with Ranged (Blackpowder), but the weapons lose all Weapon Qualities whilst retaining their flaws.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Range</h3>\n<p>A weapon’s range is its medium range in yards. Chapter 5: Rules presents modifiers if a weapon is at Point Blank, Short, Long, or Extreme range. Calculate ranges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Calculating Range Bands</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Point Blank = Range ÷ 10</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Short = Range ÷ 2</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Long = Range x 2</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Extreme = Range x 3</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Foundry Note: </strong><em>Click on the weapon's range in the combat tab to see a breakdown of the range bands for that weapon</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Weapon Qualities</h3>\n<p>Some weapons have specific advantages over others, which are described with Weapon Qualities.</p>\n<h4>Accurate</h4>\n<p>The weapon is accurate and easy to hit with. Gain a bonus of +10 to any Test when firing this weapon.</p>\n<h4>Blackpowder</h4>\n<p>The crack of gunfire followed by gouts of smoke and confusion can be terrifying. If you are targeted by a Blackpowder weapon, you must pass an Average (+20) Cool Test or take a Broken Condition, even if the shot misses.</p>\n<h4>Blast (Rating)</h4>\n<p>All Characters within (Rating) yards of the struck target point take SL+Weapon Damage, and suffer any Conditions the weapon inflicts.</p>\n<h4>Damaging</h4>\n<p>A Damaging weapon can use the higher score from either the units die or the SL to determine the Damage caused from a successful hit. For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test and the target number was 52 you can choose to use the SL, which in this case is 2, or the units die result, which is 4. An Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Defensive</h4>\n<p>Defensive weapons are designed to parry incoming attacks. If you are wielding such a weapon, gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Melee Test when you oppose an incoming attack.</p>\n<h4>Distract</h4>\n<p>Distracting weapons can be used to drive an opponent back due to their dangerous or whip-like natures. Instead of causing Damage, a successful attack with a Distracting weapon can force an opponent back 1 yard per SL by which you win the Opposed Test.</p>\n<h4>Entangle</h4>\n<p>Your weapon wraps around your opponents, entangling them. Any opponent successfully hit by your weapon gains the Entangled Condition with a Strength value equal to your Strength Characteristic. When Entangling an opponent, you cannot otherwise use the weapon to hit. You can end the Entangling whenever you wish.</p>\n<h4>Fast</h4>\n<p>Fast weapons are designed to strike out with such speed that parrying is not an option, leaving an opponent skewered before they can react. A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence, either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. </p>\n<p>Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other) as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Hack</h4>\n<p>Hacking weapons have heavy blades that can hack through armour with horrific ease. If you hit an opponent, you Damage a struck piece of armour or shield by 1 point as well as wounding the target.</p>\n<h4>Impact</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their weight or design. On a successful hit, add the result of the units die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon. An Undamaging weapon can never also have Impact (Undamaging takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Impale</h4>\n<p>Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under an appropriate Test in combat. </p>\n<p>If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body. Arrows and bolts require a successful Challenging (+0) Heal Test to remove — bullets require a surgeon (see the Surgery  Talent in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each unremoved arrow or bullet.</p>\n<h4>Penetrating</h4>\n<p>The weapon is highly effective at penetrating armour. Non-metal APs are ignored, and the first point of all other armour is ignored.</p>\n<h4>Pistol</h4>\n<p>You can use this weapon to attack in Close Combat.</p>\n<h4>Precise</h4>\n<p>The weapon is easy to get on target. Gain a bonus of +1 SL to any successful Test when attacking with this weapon.</p>\n<h4>Pummel</h4>\n<p>Pummel weapons are especially good at battering foes into submission. If you score a Head hit with a Pummel weapon, attempt an Opposed Strength/ Endurance test against the struck opponent. If you win the test, your opponent gains a Stunned Condition.</p>\n<h4>Repeater (Rating)</h4>\n<p>Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after each time you fire. When you use all your shots, you must fully reload the weapon using the normal rules.</p>\n<h4>Shield (Rating)</h4>\n<p>If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body. If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2 or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your Line of Sight.</p>\n<h4>Trap Blade</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead of causing a Critical Hit.</p>\n<p>If you choose to do this, enact an Opposed Strength Test, adding your SL from the previous Melee Test. If you succeed, your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the blade and may fight on as normal.</p>\n<h4>Unbreakable</h4>\n<p>The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an especially strong material. Under almost all circumstances, this weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.</p>\n<h4>Wrap</h4>\n<p>Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Flaws</h3>\n<p>Some weapons are just difficult to use, or simply dangerous, as described with Weapon Flaws.</p>\n<h4>Dangerous</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are almost as likely to hurt you as your opponent. Any failed test including an 9 on either 10s or units die results in a Fumble (see Chapter 5: Rules for more on Fumbles).</p>\n<h4>Imprecise</h4>\n<p>Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise (Imprecise takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Reload (Rating)</h4>\n<p>The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while reloading, you must start again from scratch.</p>\n<h4>Slow</h4>\n<p>Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attacks.</p>\n<h4>Tiring</h4>\n<p>The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits on a Turn you Charge.</p>\n<h4>Undamaging</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit in combat.</p>","folder":"x7ZXvJZVij1U9hlU","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":800001}}}

{"_id":"sBmYOLfNwyT8lnwA","name":"Skills and Talents","content":"<p>Skills represent areas of trained learning or experience, and Talents describe special abilities your Character can access. A list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. The Skills and Talents you have available to you at character generation are determined by your Species and Career.</p>\n<p>When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you gain in the Advances box of the Skill. If you should learn this skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a new number of Advances. If you learn a Talent, record it in your Talent list on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>. Basic Skills represent common abilities that everyone can perform — you can use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal to the governing characteristic. Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, and you can only use these skills if you have taken at least one Advance in them.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some Talents can be learned multiple times. If you have an opportunity to learn a Talent a second time, check the talent on your character sheet to see if it can be learned multiple times, and mark how many times you’ve learned it on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>What Are Skill Advances?</em></h3>\n<p><em>Like Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances show specific training in a Skill. All Skills are associated with a Characteristic, and the number of Advances you have in the Skill is added to that Characteristic to show you how skilled you are.

Any Random Talents are determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you already have, you may reroll. <strong>Note</strong>: All Characters are assumed to be fluent in Reikspiel,, the language of the Empire, and do not need to take it as a Skill.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong><em>The Species skills/talents are shown via the '/char' command, as well as the random talents.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Career Skills and Talents</h3>\n<p>You begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path.

{"_id":"u7IJ1xm4pO5s9QgS","name":"Corruption","content":"<p>Every Festag, Sigmarite priests preach from high pulpits about the dangers of the Ruinous Powers, about how good folk must avoid the temptations of daemons whispering from every shadow. They declare all souls are in perpetual peril, mere footsteps from falling to corruption and mutation. And they might be right.</p>\n<p>Corruption points are used to show the slow, gradual slip of your soul to the Dark Gods of Chaos. Whenever you are exposed to a potential source of corruption, you may accrue Corruption points. The more you have, the closer you are drawing to Chaos, and the darker your soul becomes until, eventually, you change…</p>\n<h3>Gaining Corruption Points</h3>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">During play, there are two primary routes to gaining corruption: dark deals and corrupting influences .</p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"2\">Dark Deals</h4>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Sometimes, you just have to succeed. Most commonly this means passing an important Test. Should such a Test fail, you can use a Fortune point to reroll the Test, hopefully passing the second time. But what if it fails again? Or you have no Fortune points remaining? Then it’s time for a dark deal.</p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">You can purposefully choose to take a Corruption point to reroll a Test, even if it has been rerolled already. This is always a choice for you, not the GM — although there is nothing wrong with the GM gently reminding you that you could try again. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Options: Encroaching Darkness...</span></h3>\n<p aria-level=\"2\"><em>Some inventive players prefer to embellish their dark deals with disturbing events happening in-game. If you like the sound of this, it’s up to you how such events should manifest, but tailoring them to the story of the character involved is always a good idea. Perhaps taint subtly influences the local area causing animals to flee or plants to gently rot? </em></p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\"><em>Perhaps you could roll on the @Table[minormis]{Miscast table} to create a random event (especially appropriate for wizards and witches)? Think of the Test tied to the dark deed, and then consider soul-staining events that could occur to ensure your success.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 aria-level=\"2\">Corrupting Influences</h4>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Corruption points are usually gained by exposure to a place, person, or object tainted by Chaos, or to a situation especially beloved to one of the Dark Gods. </p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">If you encounter a corrupting influence, attempt a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test, or Challenging (+0) Cool Test, as determined by the GM — usually physical influences are resisted with Endurance, spiritual corruption is resisted with Cool. </p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL you will need to avoid it. The following provides some examples of corrupting influences with the number of SL needed to completely avoid Corruption points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: Click on the links below to prompt players to resist Corruption, or use the `/corruption` chat command. e.g. /corruption moderate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>@Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure}</strong></p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">These corrupting influences, although relatively trivial, still endanger a weak soul. If a Test is failed to resist such a minor exposure, gain 1 Corruption point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL needed to avoid. The following are examples:</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Witness a Lesser Daemon</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact with a Mutant, refined Warpstone, or Chaos-tainted artefact</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Giving in to despair, rage, excess, or the need to change your lot. </span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Being near Warpstone</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged exposure to Chaos worshippers, Chaos Cult Temples, Mutant Lairs, and Similar</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"none\">@Corruption[moderate]{Moderate Exposure}</span></strong></p>\n<p>Moderate corrupting influences are a danger to every soul and should be avoided under all circumstances. If a Test is failed, gain 2 Corruption points. On a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 1 Corruption point. On a Success (2+), you gain no Corruption points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Witness Multiple Daemons</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Embracing despair, rage, excess, or the desire to become someone new</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged exposure to refined Warpstone</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Brief exposure to an environment steeped with <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Dhar, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">used by Necromancers and Chaos Sorcerers.</span></span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"none\">@Corruption[major]{Major Exposure}</span></strong></p>\n<p>If you find yourself confronted with a major corrupting influence, flee. Stay for too long, and you may never be the same again. For each failed Test to resist a major exposure, gain 3 Corruption points. If you pass with a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 2 Corruption points. On a Success (2–3), you gain 1 Corruption point. Only if you score an Impressive Success (4+), do you gain no Corruption points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Witness a Greater Daemon</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact. </span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Making a deal with a Daemon</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Consuming refined Warpstone</span> </li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged exposure to an environment steeped with <span data-contrast=\"auto\">dhar </span></span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span></p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Corrupting</span></h3>\n<p>No-one is left unscathed by exposure to the Ruinous Powers. Eventually, even the strongest fall, their mind and bodies twisting into new unrecognisable forms.</p>\n<p>Should you ever gain more Corruption points than your Willpower Bonus plus your Toughness Bonus, immediately attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, you have managed to hold off your corruption for now but will have to Test again next time you gain Corruption Points. If you fail, then either your body or mind is about to mutate.</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dissolution of Body and Mind</span> </p>\n<p>As corruption ravages your soul, the warping breath of Chaos whispers within, either fanning your flesh into a fresh, new form, or fracturing your psyche with exquisite knowledge it can never unlearn.</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span>First, lose Corruption points equal to your Willpower Bonus as you mutate. Next, roll percentile dice and refer to the following table to determine whether it’s your body or your mind that blossoms anew.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Elf</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Halfling</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Human</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Body</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">-</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p>01-10</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">01-50</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">01-05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Mind</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">01-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">51-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">06-10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now roll on either the @Table[mutatephys]{Physical Corruption} Table or the @Table[mutatemental]{Mental Corruption Table} to see what happens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>If you have <strong>Enemy In Shadows </strong>installed, you can also use @Table[expandedmutatephys]{Expanded Physical} or @Table[expandedmutatemental]{Expanded Mental Mutations}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Corruption Limits</h4>\n<p>A soul can only withstand so much corruption before it collapses upon itself, leaving a mutated, gibbering mess. Should you survive long enough to gain more mutations than your Toughness Bonus, or more mental corruptions than your Willpower Bonus, you have fallen to Chaos, your soul completely lost to the uncaring Chaos Gods. At this point, it’s time to create a new character. Your current one is now damned, becoming an NPC controlled by the GM, meaning you may well see the wretched creature again…</p>\n<h3>Losing Corruption Points</h3>\n<p>Once the claws of the Dark Gods have sunk into your soul, removing their vile stain is difficult, but not impossible. Beyond the less-than-desirable option of losing Corruption points by gaining mutations, there are two other methods of losing Corruption points: dark whispers and absolution .</p>\n<h4>Dark Whispers</h4>\n<p>Even considering the inscrutable plans of the Dark Gods is enough to break a pious man’s sanity, so trying to fathom their intent, and why they reach out to twist one mortal soul or another, is not just foolish, it’s extraordinarily dangerous. But reach out they do.</p>\n<p>The GM may ask to spend one of your Corruption points to use the darkness building in your soul to twist your actions. The choice to do this or not is always in your hands, but if you agree, you lose 1 Corruption Point. Examples of what may be asked include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letting an enemy escape.</li>\n<li>‘Accidentally’ shooting an ally.</li>\n<li>Falling asleep on watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, if you deny the GM and choose to do none of those potentially terrible things, you keep your Corruption point, but the Ruinous Powers still hold a portion of your soul.</p>\n<h4>Absolution</h4>\n<p>As Corruption points build, and you feel the oppressive fist of the Dark Gods curling around your beleaguered soul, your dread may lead you to seek absolution. But simply asking forgiveness from a local preacher won’t be enough. The stain of the Dark Gods’ touch isn’t so easily scrubbed clean. The exact limits of what is required to remove Corruption is left in the hands of the GM, but it is rarely, if ever, simple. </p>\n<p>Printed adventures may include situations where Corruption can be removed, but if you wish to seek your own route to absolution, consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleanse a profane temple to the Dark Gods. Though the very act may expose you to more corruption…</li>\n<li>Complete a holy pilgrimage and receive a blessing from a high priest at the end of the long, dangerous journey.</li>\n<li> </li>\n<li>Destroy an unholy artefact, or otherwise render it safe, foiling the schemes of the Dark Gods.</li>\n<li>Join a holy order and dedicate your life to one of the Gods opposed to Chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Slow Manifestations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Manifesting a mutation of the body or mind can come quickly, but normally it’s a slow process, perhaps starting as an itch, patch of flaky skin, or a new tic, and only later developing into a new eye, unexpected feathers, or an entirely new mindset. If you would prefer to draw the mutation process out, perhaps to play upon the horror of the inevitable mutations to come, you are encouraged to do so. This is left in the hands of the GM to detail according to individual taste and preference.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":300001}}}
{"_id":"uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z","name":"Status","content":"<p>Old World society is highly stratified — common folk are in little doubt as to their place in the society whilst the elite enjoy power and prestige that is brutally enforced and therefore largely unchallenged. Most people in between are acutely aware of their standing, and preoccupied with improving it. This is represented by Status, which can modify the interactions between people of different social classes.</p>\n<h3>Tiers and Standing</h3>\n<p>Status is expressed as a Tier — from lowest to highest: Brass, Silver, or Gold — and a Standing — which is a number, generally from 1–5, showing how respected the character is within their Tier. </p>\n<p>If you have a higher Tier than another character, you have higher Status. If you are in the same Tier as another character, then you are higher Status if you have a higher Standing.</p>\n<h4>The Three Tiers</h4>\n<p>The most important distinctions in Status are the three Tiers:</p>\n<p><strong>The Gold Tier</strong>: Reserved for the rulers of society; those who directly serve them as advisors, protectors, and maintainers of the law; and the independently wealthy. To reach this position requires hard work, success, and not a little luck. All in the Gold tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than those in the Silver and Brass tiers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Silver Tier</strong>: Populated by well-to-do townsfolk and those following professions requiring skill and expertise. Tradesmen, craftsmen, and merchants make up most of the upper ranks of the tier, whilst the bottom is filled by those providing services. These folk lead relatively humble lives, but they are still respectable. People of the Silver Tier are of higher Status than those of the Brass Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>The Brass Tier</strong>: Occupied by peasants and those in the poorest professions which often require no particular skills. The Brass Tier also contains many criminals, ne’er-do-wells, and those who don’t make any living at all. </p>\n<h3>Determining Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is determined by your Career level. Beside the name of your Career level is your Status, marked as ‘Brass 3’, ‘Silver 1’, or similar. This is the Tier and Standing. Should you change Career, check the new Status by the name of your new Career Level, and mark it on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>Status changes for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You change Career.</li>\n<li>You gain a Talent that modifies Status.</li>\n<li>The GM imposes a change in Status due to in-game events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever causes a change in Status, you should take time to explain what exactly occurred, and the impact this has on your character. If you have changed to a different Career Level, say from a Student to a Scholar, what precipitated this? What subject did you study? And how does your character now feel after graduating? Taking time to explain your changing circumstances makes your character more rounded and believable.</p>\n<h3>The Effects of Status</h3>\n<p>Status influences a number of situations that impact your Character. Often these involve making Tests easier or more difficult. The GM may expand or limit these influences as they wish.</p>\n<h4>Charm</h4>\n<p>Status impacts Charm significantly, with those of higher Status more easily able to get what they want, and those of lower status finding it harder to secure influence. In most circumstances, those of a higher Tier gain a bonus of +10 to Charm Tests influencing those with a lower tier. Similarly, those of lower Tier suffer a penalty of –10 to influence those of a higher Tier. The GM may also apply these modifiers to those of different Standing in the same Tier, but this is rarer.</p>\n<p>If the target of the Charm attempt is atypical, this might not work as usual however. An individual who ‘Defies Status’ would mean no modifiers apply, and one with ‘Extreme Views’ might mean that the opposite modifiers apply (–10 rather than +10, for example).</p>\n<h4>Entertain</h4>\n<p>Status does not normally influence Entertain tests. However, a GM ought to consider that some entertainments are thought fitting to particular venues. A peasant playing a hurdy-gurdy is not likely to go down well at an opera house, whilst even a mediocre orchestra is likely to draw a significant audience if it starts performing on the village green.</p>\n<p>As such the GM might like to consider the sort of audience a performance is normally aimed at, and the audience that is actually available, and apply suitable modifiers.</p>\n<h4>Intimidate</h4>\n<p>If you have a higher Status than the target of your Intimidate, you typically gain a bonus of +10.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>Gossip tends to be stilted between people of different classes. Any Gossip Test between individuals of different Tiers suffers a penalty of –10.</p>\n<h4>Leadership</h4>\n<p>Status plays a very important role in Leadership. Indeed, the State Army normally only grants higher ranks to those of noble birth.</p>\n<p>If you are a higher tier than the target of your Leadership Test, you gain a bonus of +10. If you are two tiers higher, the bonus increases to +20.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining Status</h3>\n<p>In order to benefit (or suffer) from Status, you have to act in accordance with your role in society.</p>\n<p>It may be that you wish to pass incognito, presenting yourself anonymously. Typically, you will be counted as having a Status of Brass 3 if you do this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Hans the noble wears the latest fashions and always buys the best trappings. He rides his lovingly groomed horse into a village, pausing only to let his herald announce his presence to all. He fully benefits from his Gold 2 Status. His brother Heinrich dresses in old clothes, hides all his courtly garb under the bed, and acts like a nameless wanderer. He is treated as having a Status of Brass 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Keeping Up Appearances</h4>\n<p>Characters need to spend a certain amount of money to maintain their lifestyle. As explained in @JournalEntry[5gvMwgLgn3fAW3VM]{The Cost of Living} there are minimum expectations of expenditure for each Tier.</p>\n<p>Should a character fail to live up to these levels of expenditure they will begin to be perceived as being of lower Status, losing 1 point of Standing per week. </p>\n<p>To stop this decline, the character must resume spending the money expected of them, whereupon they regain 1 point of Standing a week until they recover the lost points.</p>\n<p>Should Standing reach 0, your tier drops by one and your Standing is set to 5. If you are already at the lowest tier, then your Status sticks at Brass 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Pietr is a Noble and has been slumming it in the East End of Altdorf for the last two weeks, letting his Standing of Gold 3 drop to Gold 1 as he eats poor food, drinks cheap beer, and hostels in flop houses. Should another week pass and Pietr does not change his ways, his Standing will drop to Gold 0, which immediately becomes Silver 5. Should this occur, Pietr’s father will almost certainly step in to curtail the family shame…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Earning Money with Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is directly linked to the amount of money you earn while working. The higher your Status, the more money you can earn as your good name attracts business. If the GM agrees, during play you can spend a week to work in your Career assuming you are in a place where such is feasible (it’s hard to be a Watchman in the middle of a wasteland). This is called Earning.</p>\n<p>When Earning, make an <strong>Average (+20) Dramatic</strong> Test against the Earning Skill of your Career (the Skill marked in italics in the Career’s first level). If passed, you receive the money marked in the table below. If failed, you receive half the money. If an Astounding Failure (–6) is scored, you have a very bad week, and earn nothing (or have your money stolen, or some similar mishap). </p>\n<p>This total is not strictly speaking how much money you earn, it’s more a representation of how much money you have left at the end of the week after all your expenses are taken into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the same amount of coin earned with an @JournalEntry[lRWvy2uSVgq4RADa]{Income} Endeavour.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gunther the Coachman decides he’ll work for the Four Seasons Coaching House for a week while his peers research a library for things he frankly doesn’t understand, and secretly thinks may be heretical if he did. The GM agrees to let Gunther enact some Earning, so Gunther rolls against his Drive (Coach) skill (his Earning Skill for Coachman) and passes. Given his Status is Silver 2, he can roll 2d10 and earn that much silver. Unfortunately, he only rolls a 1 and a 2 for a total of 3 silver shillings; clearly Gunther was drinking a lot after his long work shifts, and has little coin remaining…</em></p>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":1000001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":1000001}}}

A winding path coils up the steep, craggy face from the small, seemingly insignificant jetty at its base to the severe walls of the squat citadel crowning the rocky mount. Captains give it a wide berth when they pass, the more superstitious among them making an oﬀering of salt and steel to Grandfather Reik to safeguard their passage. No pennants ﬂy atop the grim battlements, though the occasional gleam from a guard’s helmet attests to the troops patrolling the ramparts.</p>\n<p>Unknown to most, the Stone is a secure prison containing dangerous criminals that, for various sensitive, political reasons cannot simply be executed. Some have powerful friends and family, or are themselves nobles whose crimes, if publicly acknowledged would cause scandal and shame to the great and good of the Reikland. Others are political hostages, held to ensure the compliance of wayward relatives. And, of course, a few simply know too much, their precious secrets safeguarded in The Stone against their future need.

The Crooked Corridor is a narrow gorge through the mountains not far from the border with the Wasteland. It is useless to most merchants, being far too tight for wagons or horses, and dangerous to boot as much of the path is perched precariously on the edge of steep cliﬀs, meaning the slightest slip of a foot could lead to a painfully inglorious end.</p>\n<p>Completely impassable in the winter and perilous at all other times, the Crooked Corridor was known only to goat herders and smugglers until a spate of Greenskin raids brought the pass to the attention of the authorities.</p>\n<p>Several decades ago, Emperor Mattheus II ordered the construction of a fortress to watch over the Crooked Corridor after repeated invasion. Nine years later, Blackstone Tower was completed, drawing its name from the locally quarried dark stone that forms its walls, and the slate that tops its towers.</p>\n<p>Its position high above the Crooked Corridor oﬀered the Emperor’s sharpshooters an excellent perch from which to employ their lethal skills; however, its status as a Reiklander bastion was short-lived. An oversight at the planning stage resulted in the tower being built on lands claimed by the Dwarfs of Karak Ziﬂin. Not wanting to upset the Dwarfs, the Emperor ceded the tower, much to the annoyance of the Margrave of Geetburg who had helped finance it.</p>\n<p>Today, the Dwarfs ‘generously’ allow a limited garrison to barrack alongside their own troops at Blackstone Tower, a largely rebuilt structure. With the Reiklanders chafing under the Dwarfs’ leadership, and the Dwarfs constantly belittling the shoddy human stonework they’ve yet to replace, the Tower is a powderkeg of grievances and resentment, generating a tense —and some would say unsustainable — atmosphere.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ego vs Ego vs Ego</strong>: Duke Folcard of Montfort, King Rorek Granitehand of Karak Ziflin, and Margrave Manegold von Geetburg all walk into a tower. It may sound like the start of a joke, but it’s more likely the beginning of a war. And Alram Habich — Architect of <strong>Blackstone Tower</strong>, and devotee of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of Change — is delighted at the trouble his tower is causing. Unbeknownst to Habich, his former apprentice has uncovered his once master’s true allegiance, but doesn’t know what to do. So he drowns his fears in The Forked Mane tavern, waiting for someone, anyone, who’ll believe him.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":"GI7xBjKQuHF94BnM","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Settlements"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Settlements","sort":400001}}}

{"_id":"vu4Ke5ObepzKBWof","name":"Prayers","content":"<p>A small number of the faithful stand apart from their peers, seemingly able to appeal for their deity’s direct intervention in the form of miracles. Those who perform such feats are known by many names in different parts of the Old World — including: Living Saints, Gods’ Servants, The Hallowed, Divine Wills, Anointed Ones — but, in the Empire, they are most commonly referred to as ‘Blessed’, which is often used as a title. So, if Sister Anna where to be Blessed by Sigmar — i.e. granted Sigmar’s grace, able to have her prayers answered — she would become ‘Blessed Anna’, or, in full, ‘Blessed Anna, Sister of Sigmar’.</p>\n<h3>The Blessed</h3>\n<p>There are two Talents that specifically mark out those Blessed by the gods: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QyjWtSdnVMT04l5Y]{Bless} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.voV0C2ar1bKpcpnH]{Invoke}. Characters with the Bless Talent may enact Blessings, which are minor manifestations of divine will, while the Invoke Talent allows the Blessed to call on their gods for more powerful Miracles.</p>\n<h4>Blessings and Miracles</h4>\n<p>Blessing and Miracles are prayers spoken by one of the Blessed, and then empowered by a god. To enact a Blessing or Miracle, make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Pray </strong>Test. If you score a Success, your Blessing or Miracle manifests according to its rules, and a high SL will give you bonus effects. If you score a Failure, your words are spoken, but your god, for whatever reason, refuses to listen. If you Fumble the Pray Test, you have offended your god and must roll on the Wrath of the Gods table.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>You must be able to speak to intone the required prayer, rite, chant, or song to enact a Blessing or Miracle. Each of your Blessings or Miracles can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for an existing one to come to an end before using the same prayer again. </p>\n<p>Multiple invocations of the same prayer by different individuals do not offer cumulative bonuses. Thus, intoning two Blessings of Finesse will only provide a bonus of +10 to Dexterity.</p>\n<h3>Sin Points</h3>\n<p>The Blessed are watched closely by the gods, and risk gaining the disfavour of their deities if they should act contrary to their gods’ will. In game, this is represented with Sin points.</p>\n<p>If you violate any of the Cult Strictures listed under your god, the GM will award one or more Sin Points. Every time you receive a Sin point, it is added it to your running total. There is no maximum to the number of Sin points you can earn. The more points you have, the more upset your god is likely to be should you call upon divine aid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>It's a Sin!</em></h3>\n<p><em>There are many different ways Blessed Priests can break their strictures; GMs should consider the scale of the infraction when awarding Sin Points, and allocate them proportionately, normally scoring 1 to 3. For instance, one of the strictures of the cult of Myrmidia is to respect prisoners of war. If a Myrmidian priest were to deny a thirsty prisoner of war a drink of water, this may earn a single Sin point. Beating a prisoner would be a great infraction, securing maybe 2 Sin points. Torturing or killing a helpless prisoner is unacceptable to Myrmidia, easily earning 3 or maybe more Sin points. </em></p>\n<p><em>Kind GMs may wish to warn players before they commit infractions, especially if they are new to WFRP.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Sin and Wrath</h4>\n<p>Appealing to your deity when you have been acting contrary to the god’s wishes is risky. Whenever you make a Pray Test, if the units die of the result is equal to or less than your current Sin point total, then you will suffer the Wrath of the Gods, even if the Pray Test is successful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Preach It, Sister!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Each of the gods have different styles of prayers, designed to be intoned in different ways. Whether these are the warcries of Ulric, the shanties of Manaan, or the threnodies of Morr, each requires the words be spoken (or sung) firmly, and with conviction. </em></p>\n<p><em>To represent this, the GM may require that any Pray Tests that are intoned quietly or without confidence have a higher Difficulty.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em>You've Got To Pray!</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If a character behaves in a particularly pious manner, such as completing an arduous pilgrimage, or making a significant donation to their cult, the GM may wish to remove one or more Sin Points with a successful Pray Test, used to show you are begging for absolution. This, of course, also risks the chance of Wrath of the Gods. Otherwise, the only way to remove Sin Points is by rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Wrath Of The Gods</h3>\n<p>The Wrath of Gods table is referenced whenever you Fumble a Pray Test, or when the units die of a Pray Test is equal or lower than your current Sin points. The GM may also use it, or pluck results from it, whenever you foolishly insult any of the gods. When rolling on the @Table[wrath], add +10 to the roll for each Sin Point you have accrued. After rolling and applying the result, reduce your Sin points by 1, to a minimum of 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>You can add a modifier to a table by right clicking the table link</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Penance</h4>\n<p>Some Wrath of the Gods results require penance. The GM can decide upon a suitable penance depending on your misdeed, or they may prefer you to choose your own penance, with further punishment awaiting if you are insufficiently penitent. Examples of typical penances are listed in each cult description. Penances may come in the form of a vision, divine inspiration or, very rarely, by direct communication from your deity. If you are not worthy of such contact, a penance may be conveyed through another member of your cult. Alternatively, a Divine Servant of the cult could manifest — this could be a dead teacher, a figure of legend, or an appropriate animal — and inform you what is required. The GM should consider the sins involved, and how the god in question would likely react to these.</p>","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":200001}}}

{"_id":"y2Ijt62xwWflH1f5","name":"The Reik","content":"<p>The Reik carries more traffic and trade than all the other rivers in the Old World combined. Indeed, so massive is the river that almost half the fresh water of the Old World ﬂows down its length, for it not only drains all the Reikland with its many tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond. By the time the Reik ﬂows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard engineering methods. As this immense watercourse approaches @JournalEntry[4WEhiObwXJKErVFi]{Altdorf} to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form the foggy @JournalEntry[fZKynnyBSGStMXEQ]{Altdorf Flats}. Many of the thinner distributaries caused by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural center for trade as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for many hundreds of miles. This single fact has secured Altdorf’s dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally.</p>\n<p>Beyond the Altdorf Flats, the boggy channels reconverge and the Reik begins its long journey westwards to the sea. By this point, it is so wide the opposite bank sometimes slips into mist, and is so deep that even the largest sea-faring vessel can navigate without fear. Resultingly, warships of the Imperial Navy, some so large to have crews out-numbering the populations of smaller towns, not only patrol these waters, <strong>but are built there, most launching from the Reiksport, a deep-water harbour built on the shores of @JournalEntry[4WEhiObwXJKErVFi]{Altdorf}</strong>. Rocky islands are common in this last stretch, most of which are secured with ancient fortresses, overridden by river pirates, or abandoned completely, boasting nothing more than a handful of old smugglers’ coves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Grandfather Reik's Isle</strong>: Sailors love swapping stories of <strong>Grandfather Reik’s Isle</strong> — a mythical island of the <strong>River Reik</strong> governed by the god of the river itself. The Cult of Manann in Altdorf is all too happy to support these stories, hoping to get ahead of their rivals in Marienburg, and claim Grandfather Reik is naught more than Manann. But others whisper that the Grandfather may actually by Stromfels — God of Sharks, Pirates and Wreckers. They state in hushed tones that ‘Reik’ sounds a lot like ‘Wreck’, and the river swallows more than its fair share of ships! But Grandfather Reik is neither, and it is not happy with such presumptions. So, the next folk to land on his island will be his messengers, whether they like it or not...</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>40-Feet of Fame</strong>: For 30 years, Terenz Gaubatz — Imperial Zoologist, and dedicated cryptoid debunker — has been haunted by the loss of ‘the General’. This supposedly 40-foot Stirpike was caught, butchered, and inconveniently eaten before Gaubatz could confirm its existence. However, recent sightings near <strong>Lengern </strong>on the <strong>River Reik</strong> talk of a school of the monstrous fish. Given their rumoured size, it’s possible the General spawned before it died. If so, a living specimen would be a treasure in and of itself (not to mention the gold Gaubatz would award its deliverer).</li>\n</ul>","folder":"TWZmPUMqO1y8ZmP9","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rivers, Canals, and Lakes"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rivers, Canals, and Lakes","sort":500001}}}
{"_id":"y5TQUTaM03CTzmlD","name":"Adding Detail","content":"<p>The bare bones of your character are in place, so let’s add some details, fleshing your character out in your imagination, determining what you look like, how you think, and what drives you. </p>\n<h3>Name</h3>\n<p>While you can choose any name that fits the world, here are some hints and tips to help choose one that’s right for you.</p>\n<h4>Human Reiklander Names</h4>\n<p>Reiklanders usually have a forename and a surname. Forenames include:</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev, Erika, Frauke, Frederich, Gerner, Gertraud, Haletha, Heinrich, Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke, Sebastien, Sigfreda, Talther, Talunda, Ulrich, Ulrika, Werther, Willelma, Wilryn.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Human Names And Their Origins</em></h3>\n<p><em>Human names in WFRP are often taken from the real world, making it easy to research fun names online. The Reikland and much of The Empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are loosely medieval French.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: Use the /name command to generate names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Reikland, Human family surnames passed on from one generation to the next are most common in cities and towns, while in villages Humans are more likely to take on an individual surname when they reach adulthood. It’s common to take a surname from where you were born, such as ‘Wilhelm of Auerswald’. The nobility often have two surnames, one is the name of their House and the other is preceded by ‘von’ to indicate where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely.</p>\n<p>The most common surnames are derived from your occupation, or the occupation of a parent or grandparent. Examples include: Bauer (Farmer), Fleischer (Butcher), Schmidt (Smith), and Schuster (Cobbler). If a character has a particularly noticeable physical trait, this might be used as a surname. This can often be passed down from parents to children too, which can become confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a short person claiming to be Lang (Tall). Some other examples include: Augenlos (one eye), Dunn (very thin), Laut (loud voice), Stark (Strong).</p>\n<h3>Dwarf Names</h3>\n<p>Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan name.</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Forenames</h4>\n<p>Dwarf names tend to be short and sturdy like the people they represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important ancestors, although individual clan traditions vary. Another common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun, Snorri.</p>\n<p><strong>Khazalid examples</strong>: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard), Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril (Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Surnames</h4>\n<p>Dwarf surnames are based on who raised the Dwarf, with the following suffixes the most common in use: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>sdottir: Daughter of…</li>\n<li>snev: Nephew of…</li>\n<li>sniz: Niece of…</li>\n<li>sson: Son of…</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz</p>\n<p>It’s common as Dwarfs age and accrue deeds to their names to adopt a nickname based on physical appearance, prowess, or deed. These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it’s considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn’t represent the true character of a Dwarf. If such a nickname is adopted, it usually replaces the surname completely. So, Gerka Kardadottir would become Gerka Blackhand if she took the nickname ‘Blackhand’. Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but Dwarfs usually translate such to Reikspiel in order to better explain themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid, Redhammer, Stonefist</p>\n<h4>Clan Name</h4>\n<p>Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not abandoned Dwarf tradition, which some Dwarfs living in the Empire have, especially rogue engineers). The Clan Name is always derived from the ancestor who founded the Clan, and is often sourced in a Nickname, often expressed in Khazalid. In practice, Dwarfs rarely use their Clan Name outside Dwarf society.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani, Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki</p>\n<p><strong>Common Grey Mountain Clans</strong>: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger, Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk</p>\n<h4>Elf Names</h4>\n<p>Elves normally only admit to having names comprising of a forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Forenames</strong></p>\n<p>The Elves use a naming system quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Eltharin (the common language of High Elves and Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on more than simple syllables to convey meaning. The easiest way to create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Epithets</strong></p>\n<p>When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves with a forename and an epithet rather than attempt to explain the deeper concepts of Kindreds, Kinbands, or Houses. These epithets are always translated into Reikspiel as they are much easier for other species to pronounce and understand. Among High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical appearance, but can be more obscure. Wood Elf epithets typically reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin.</p>\n<p><strong>High Elf examples</strong>: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart, Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign</p>\n<p><strong>Wood Elf examples</strong>: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper, Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner</p>\n<h4>Halfling Names</h4>\n<p>Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees are not confused.</p>\n<p><strong>Halfling Forenames</strong></p>\n<p>Halflings proudly bear grand names drawn from their long family trees, but they rarely use these outside official business. Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of their ancestral name. Some Halfling’s diminutives are completely unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive, like Rosie or Scrumper. </p>\n<p>Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer, Guv, or Nan. Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human names have now become ‘traditional’ Halfling names. </p>\n<p><strong>Examples (with diminutives)</strong>: Antoniella (Anni), Esmerelda (Esme), Ferdinand (Fred), Heironymus (Hiro), Maximilian (Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)</p>\n<h4>Halfling Clan Names</h4>\n<p>Halfling clan names are almost exclusively related to food and drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics of the ancestor who first took the name. Halflings who have the same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly how. </p>\n<p>Human’s tendency to have the same surname despite being unrelated causes confusion among some Halflings, who will happily pinch pies from a Schmidt on one street because a Schmidt on another street short-changed them. </p>\n<p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot, Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble</p>\n<h3>Physical Details</h3>\n<p>When it comes to cosmetic physical details — those aspects of your appearance that don’t influence the game directly — you may either roll them randomly or choose from the range available to your Species. </p>\n<h4>Age</h4>\n<p>Average natural lifespans are around 60 for a Human, 120 for Halflings, and over 200 for a Dwarf, while Elves don’t appear to age at all and have been known to live for a thousand years or more. Choose your Character’s age or use the /char command.</p>\n<h4>Eye Colour</h4>\n<p>While most species roll once on the table below, Elves may roll twice: their innately magical natures mean they often have variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut.</p>\n<p>@Table[eyes]</p>\n<h4>Hair Colour</h4>\n<p>All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they move through middle age, then eventually turns white as they reach old age. </p>\n<p>By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any signs of age. Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always.</p>\n<p>@Table[hair]</p>\n<h4>Height</h4>\n<p>Average heights are: Dwarf (4’8”), Elf (6’5”), Halfling (3’6”), with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere around 5’9” in the Reikland. If you want a truly random upper height for Humans, if either die rolls a 10, roll one more die and add it to the height total.</p>\n<p>Use /char to generate height.</p>\n<h3>Ambitions</h3>\n<p>Ambitions are a Character’s goals in life – what they want to achieve. All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term Ambition. </p>\n<h4>Choosing Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Consult with your GM when choosing your Ambitions. Your GM has final say on the acceptability of an Ambition, and whether it is short-term or long-term. Should you wish to change an Ambition, you may do so between sessions. </p>\n<h4>Short-term Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly sooner. Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition should take at least two or three sessions to complete.</p>\n<p>Example short-term Ambitions include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival.</li>\n<li>Avenging a fallen comrade.</li>\n<li>Befriending a reclusive scholar. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Long-term Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in your life than a realistic outcome.</p>\n<p>Examples of long-term Ambitions include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Owning your own coaching inn.</li>\n<li>Building your village into a thriving town.</li>\n<li>Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence. </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Nefarious Plans</em></h3>\n<p><em>You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other players in your party, especially if they are controversial or clandestine. If you want to overthrow the Emperor, or legalise Necromancy in the Reikland, chances are your Witch Hunter ally won’t approve!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Achieving Your Ambitions</h4>\n<p>If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the end of the session.  If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you may either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. </li>\n<li>Retire your Character — who becomes an NPC under your GM’s control — and gain a bonus of half your earned XP of your current character to spend on your next character.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a great source of adventure leads. </p>","folder":"hflpTOpbTqmvqIxi","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Character","sort":100001}}}

He is the husband to Rhya, and father to Manaan, and is perceived by Taalites to be the king of the gods, though other cults dispute this. All nature is under his purview, from the snaking rivers to the tallest mountains, from the smallest insect to the greatest beast. He is normally portrayed as a powerfully built, virile man with long, wild hair and great spreading antlers, and is known for his volatile moods and his need to hunt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Rural folk across the Old World venerate Taal, and any who make their living in wild places take care not to offend him. Taal is the patron deity of Talabecland in the Empire, where his cult holds significant sway, influencing all levels of society.</p>\n<p>Taal’s cult has a variety of smaller orders dedicated to holy sites and groves throughout the Old World, but two orders drive the cult forwards. The Order of the Antler are the priests of the cult, who are tasked to teach Taal’s ways and protect the wild places from intrusion. </p>\n<p>These Taalites are particularly widespread in Talabecland, and their forest temples are hubs of activity for rural folk. The Longshanks are a mix of warrior-priest and templar who typically wander as individuals, cleansing Taal’s wild places of corruption and ensuring rural communities do nothing to upset Father Taal.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Normally, temples to Taal are small, rustic affairs, built of wood and rough stone in a manner unchanged for countless centuries. They are usually sited close to natural features of wonder such as waterfalls, swirling pools, and mountains, and often have small sweat lodges attached. The high temple of Taal in Talabheim is something of an anomaly when compared to this. It appears more a well-maintained, albeit wild, noble garden than a temple, and huge services are held there under the spreading rowan trees weekly. </p>\n<p>Officially, the Hierarch leads the cult from there, though he spends most of his time in the wild groves of the nearby Taalgrunhaar Forest. Shrines to Taal are barely structures at all. Some old trees are regarded as sacred, and offerings pile up at their bases. Caves, forest groves, and other natural places are also used as shrines, and usually only a local or a devout follower of Taal can find them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Taal’s penances usually involve clearing diseased or mutated monsters from wild areas, replanting sacred trees, and maintaining groves important to the cult. A cultist might also be ordered to climb a high mountain and leave a stone on a cairn at the top, or clear an obstruction at the top of a waterfall. Whatever the specific task that must be undertaken, Taal’s penances almost always challenge the cultist to survive in the wild. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Offer a prayer of thanks for every animal taken.</em></li>\n<li><em>Spend a week alone communing with the wilderness every year.</em></li>\n<li><em>Eschew metal armour; clad yourself in the hides of Taal.</em></li>\n<li><em>Rely on your own skill, not the advances of gunpowder or cold technology.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never harm an animal except in self-defence or for food or sacrifice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.By5dc8Q7ZAGpr177]{Blessing of The Hunt}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SZ88OXYo6F2q3vWb]{Animal Instincts}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.n8MfaJhczROmscCR]{King of the Wild}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.mXKrxO8WRZ9QLHA6]{Leaping Stag}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.JxmIQjVuoPcQnyPF]{Lord of the Hunt}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ONz21FviMRk3AyvE]{Tanglefoot}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.PcKMAEF6UoaPSK6d]{Tooth and Claw}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/taal.webp","folder":"Hj1xhwY7KNNNs8sp","sort":1000001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":1000001}}}

{"_id":"zUG2L9VchlHWYTeM","name":"Combat","content":"<p>Sooner or later you will need to stop someone in their tracks, or someone will try to stop you. When diplomacy fails, is not attempted, or is not understood as a basic concept, Combat begins!</p>\n<p>In Combat, lots of individuals take actions in a short space of time, many of them in direct opposition to each other. You will still be taking Tests to resolve these actions, but timing and a host of other factors become more important, so we have some rules to make everything work.</p>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<p>In Combat, the exact timing of actions matters more, so time is organised into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rounds</strong>: A Round is enough time for all characters to attempt a Test and move into position. It’s normally a just few seconds, the GM can decide exactly how long if necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Turns</strong>: During a Round, each combatant has a Turn to perform an Action and a Move.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative Order</strong>: Each combatant usually takes their Turn in order of their Initiative Characteristic, from highest to lowest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Combat Summary</h3>\n<p>Combat follows these steps until one side flees or is defeated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Surprise</strong>: The GM determines if any characters are Surprised . This normally only happens on the first round of combat. See the section below. </li>\n<li><strong>Round Begins</strong>: If the rules call for something to happen at the start of the Round , it happens now.</li>\n<li><strong>Characters Take Turns</strong>: Each combatant takes a Turn in Initiative order, starting with the highest Initiative. Each Character can normally perform a Move and an Action on their Turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Ends</strong>: The Round ends when all combatants have taken a Turn. If the rules call for something to happen at the end of the Round, it happens now.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat Steps 2–5 As Required</strong>: Continue to play through Rounds until the combat is resolved.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Initiative Order</h3>\n<p>Combatants act in Initiative order during the Round, with the highest Initiative acting first, until all involved have taken a Turn. If you want this to work quickly at the table, have the players sit in Initiative order. If multiple combatants have the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility, then roll an Opposed Agility Test, with the winner choosing who goes first for the combat. Some Talents impact combat order (see Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). Example: Tollich, with an Initiative of 38, always acts ahead of his companion, Perdita who has an Initiative of 33. If they attack a coven of cultists, each with Initiative 35, the combat order would be: Tollich (38), the Cultists (35), Perdita (33).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Roll For Initiative!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some groups prefer to randomise Initiative. There are several ways to do this, choose your favourite:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Each character rolls an Initiative Test to determine a SL.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Initiative.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Agility Bonus + Initiative Bonus.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The GM notes the results in decreasing numerical order and uses this as the Initiative Order. You could use this order for every Round (quickest option) or roll each Round (gives some variety to the order; slow characters have the chance to not always go last).</em><br /><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>You can find these initiative options in the system settings menu.<em><br /></em></p>\n<h3><em>Rounds Outside Combat</em></h3>\n<p><em>Out of combat, the exact timing of those actions is usually flexible. Sometimes it is helpful to use Rounds outside of Combat to help organise everyone’s contributions; for example, Extended Tests happen over several rounds, with one Test taken each Round. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Surprise</h3>\n<p>Taking your enemy by surprise gives you a big advantage. If one side is planning an attack, they can attempt to harness the element of surprise by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hiding</strong>: Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover. Characters may oppose this with a Perception Test if they are wary, or if the GM is feeling generous.</li>\n<li><strong>Sneaky Tactics</strong>: Attack from behind, in the dark, through heavy fog, or from above! The GM may allow a Perception Test to spot the incoming attackers if appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Distractions</strong>: Loud bangs, milling crowds and an especially engaging sermon are just some of the distractions that could harbour a surprise attack!</li>\n<li><strong>Unprepared Defenders</strong>: If the enemy are particularly unwary, the attackers automatically surprise their victims.</li>\n<li><strong>Something Else</strong>: Other sneaky and ingenious plans concocted by cunning players — the GM has the final call on the possibility of surprise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is a chance the ambushers will be spotted, the GM will typically call for <strong>Opposed Stealth vs Perception</strong> Test, usually with the character with the worst Stealth opposing all potential spotters. If the ambusher wins, each defeated character gains the @Condition[Surprised] Condition. </p>\n<p>If no-one is surprised, proceed with the combat as normal.</p>\n<p>If anyone is surprised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[PlOCivLBxMxUlqiq]{Taking Your Turn}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[fysKUlMiHSkbFnWy]{Attacking}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[IMgNDfHZZwJrKjgw]{Criticals and Fumbles}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[48AQuLalfmBgrGvg]{Combat Difficulty}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[jyyYfoRbZnX2voeM]{Ranged Combat}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[NYFfUIbUfYA3tbj8]{Two-Weapon Fighting}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[t36Z4DOhYnfX1dr3]{Unarmed Combat}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[FtzttJa76O8SnOMK]{Mounted Combat}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[sAFW2R7LeDYN5Z5F]{Advantage}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"fB8m4sZ2E3sMgszX","sort":1,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Combat","sort":1}}}

Sometimes you’ll just want to get on with the adventure and deal with journeys with a simple description of how long the journey was, and the key points along the way. Most journeys will either be by road or by river, with road the more dangerous, and cheaper, option.</p>\n<h4>Travel by Road</h4>\n<p>The roads of the Reikland are often crude but reliable. The routes between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained. However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks. Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most are tolled.</p>\n<p>There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the province. The busiest routes have coaches running several times per day. The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability is good. The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is represented along all the major routes.</p>\n<p>Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the Coaching Houses. Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place to rest before nightfall.</p>\n<h4>Travel by River</h4>\n<p>River journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even relaxing. However, this relies on finding a boat going to and from convenient locations. Dedicated passenger barges only travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or persuaded to drop people off along the way. Getting to more obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo boat, which can be difficult for large parties.</p>\n<h4>Travel Prices</h4>\n<p>The prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging, or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge for the whole package for longer journeys. Package prices can be worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices. On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin.</p>\n<p>Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with barge masters. Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work and they know what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility, and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or more. Opulent passenger vessels ply between the great cities of the Empire, like the famous Emperor Luitpold plying the River Talebec between Altdorf and Talabheim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Travel Costs</span></h3>\n<p><em>All the costs listed here are per mile travelled, and are loose guides only. Faster coaches and barges generally cost twice as much. Slower examples cost as little as half as much. Increase or decrease speed by +/– 1 for faster or slower examples. </em></p>\n<table style=\"height:153px;width:367px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\">\n<h4><strong><em>Transport</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\">\n<h4><strong><em>Movement</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\">\n<h4><strong><em>Cost</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\">\n<h4><strong><em>Distance</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>COACH</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>6</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Inside</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[2bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Outside</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[1bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>BARGE</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>8</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Cabin</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[5bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Deck</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[2bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>CAB</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>6</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[3bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per district</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>FERRY</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>4</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[1bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per 20 yards</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Travel Times</h4>\n<p>Use Movement to determine travel speed in miles per hour. So, if a party’s slowest Movement was 3, it would travel at approximately 3 miles per hour. </p>\n<p>Taking into account rests, necessary stops, and a typical topography, a party can travel the equivalent of 6 hours a day without requiring Endurance Tests. If travelling faster or farther, give a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition to those failing this Test, with extra Fatigue if Encumbered.</p>\n<p>Barge speed can increase or decrease by up to 30% if going downstream or upstream, as you determine is appropriate.</p>\n<h4>Travel Events</h4>\n<p>Whether detailing daily travel or simply choosing to allow the party to pay an appropriate fee and then arrive at their chosen destination, every now and again it’s good to throw in some travel events. It’s an opportunity to show off a different aspect of the Old World, or to give a change of pace to the adventure. </p>\n<p>An intrigue-focused game can sometimes do with a clearly defined ‘goodies vs. baddies’ Beastmen attack. A tense, bleak session can benefit from a night’s entertainment sharing camp with a travelling circus. Further, you can work these encounters into your ongoing narrative if you wish. </p>\n<p>Finding the burned-out caravans of the circus later in the journey is a poignant way of making the antagonists’ actions personal. Travel events are also great for foreshadowing events to come, or reinforcing the themes of an adventure. </p>\n<p>It is up to you how much of an issue you want these travel events to be for your players. Some could simply consist of a brief description, while others could form the basis of an entire session of play. Some GMs prefer to roll [[/gmr 1d10]] per day of travel and have an event occur on the roll of an 8 (signifying the 8-pointed symbol of Chaos — something unexpected and random has occurred), others like a single event for each journey of a day or more. This is left for you to determine, though if you are playing a printed adventure by <strong>Cubicle 7</strong> that includes a journey, suggested events and travel times will be included. So, @Table[travel] can be used as you prefer, and presumes a single event for the journey travelled.</p>\n<p>You might like to give Players the opportunity to avoid nasty events with a successful Perception Test, or Outdoor Survival, or whatever other Test makes sense at the time. If they are travelling in paid-for transportation, you might decide that gives them help in overcoming any adversities. </p>","folder":"UP3wjGkRFPHlNGhB","sort":1200001,"permission":{"default":0,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":1200001}}}
