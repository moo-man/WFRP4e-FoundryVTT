(Example: Bianca channels a spell with a CN of 3 and scores 7 SL; she chooses to bank the extra 4 SL for Overcasting effects once the spell is cast.) But this extra power is not without its cost. If the casting Test fails, you lose all channelled energy and suffer a Minor Miscast. Further, you count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your channelling or Language (Magick) Skill as a Fumble (so, 00, 99, 90, 88, etc) and any Critical or Fumble on these Tests is a Major Miscast instead.

When used during a Casting Test, a power ingredient allows you to reverse the dice and choose the result for your Casting Test. However, if the units die after reverse of your Casting Test exceeds your Willpower Bonus, the energy exceeds your grasp and you unleash a Minor Miscast. <br/> Control Ingredient: When used during a Channelling or Casting Test, a control ingredient acts as a target for out-of-control magic.
