Ingredients react differently depending on how you funnel your magic through them. Before you cast or channel, you must choose whether to use the ingredient for Power or Control. Ingredients are consumed even when the spell fails. <br/> Power Ingredient: When used during a Channelling Test, a power ingredient doubles the number of SL aquired on success (see overchannelling). When used during a Casting Test, a power ingredient allows you to reverse the dice and choose the result for your Casting Test. However, if the units die after reverse of your Casting Test exceeds your Willpower Bonus, the energy exceeds your grasp and you unleash a Minor Miscast. <br/> Control Ingredient: When used during a Channelling or Casting Test, a control ingredient acts as a target for out-of-control magic.

(Example: Bianca channels a spell with a CN of 3 and scores 7 SL; she chooses to bank the extra 4 SL for Overcasting effects once the spell is cast.) But this extra power is not without its cost. If the casting Test fails, you lose all channelled energy and suffer a Minor Miscast. Further, you count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your channelling or Language (Magick) Skill as a Fumble (so, 00, 99, 90, 88, etc) and any Critical or Fumble on these Tests is a Major Miscast instead.
