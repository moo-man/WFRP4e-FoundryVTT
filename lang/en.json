If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your primary arm location using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.",

For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test and the target number was 52 you can choose to use the SL, which in this case is 2, or the units die result, which is 4. An Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging takes precedent).",

A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence, either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other) as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes precedent).",

    "WFRP4E.Properties.Impale" : "Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under an appropriate Test in combat. If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body.

    "WFRP4E.Properties.Trapblade" : "Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead of causing a Critical Hit. If you choose to do this, enact an Opposed Strength Test, adding your SL from the previous Melee Test. If you succeed, your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the blade and may fight on as normal.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Unbreakable" : "The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an especially strong material. Under almost all circumstances, this weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Wrap" : "Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.",

This Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Fine" : "Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of social status and can be taken multiple times. The higher the quality, the more impressive it seems.",

    "WFRP4E.Properties.Imprecise" : "Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise (Imprecise takes precedent).",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Reload" : "The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while reloading, you must start again from scratch.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Slow" : "Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attack",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Tiring" : "The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits on a Turn you Charge.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This changes the Damage shown in the chat card:<br> 'Not Charging' | 'Charging' Damage.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Undamaging" : "Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit in combat.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Partial" : "The armor does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores the partial armor’s APs.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Weakpoints" : "The armor has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky. If your opponent has a weapon with the Impale Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of your armor are ignored.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Ugly" : "Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a –10 penalty.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Shoddy" : "Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster. The item breaks when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy armor breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location it protects.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Unreliable" : "Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armor are doubled.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Bulky" : "An awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this ﬂaw). Bulky clothing and armor are Enc 1 even when worn, and Fatigue penalties for armor are doubled.",

    "WFRP4E.LoreDescription.Fire" : "You may inflict +1 @Condition[Ablaze] Condition on anyone targeted by spells from the Lore of Fire, unless they also possess the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent.

    "WFRP4E.LoreDescription.Heavens" : "Spells causing Damage ignore Armour Points from metal armour, and will arc to all other targets within 2 yards, except those with the Arcane Magic (Heavens) Talent, inﬂicting hits with a Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus, handled like a magical missile.",
    "WFRP4E.LoreDescription.Metal" : "Spells inflicting Damage ignore Armor Points from metal armor, and inflict bonus Damage equal to the number of Armor Points of metal armor being worn on any Hit Location struck.

Further, you may inﬂict one @Condition[Bleeding] Condition on anyone targeted by spells from the Lore of Witchcraft. Lastly, channeling or casting spells from this Lore automatically require a roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast table} unless cast with an ingredient, where the ingredient provides no further protection should you roll a Miscast. Fortunately, ingredients for the Lore of Witchcraft are cheap and readily available: body parts of small animals for the most part.

Alternatively, a Witch may forage for parts, using the Outdoor Survival skill: a successful foraging roll receives 1 + SL ingredients, as described under Gathering Food and Herbs",

    "WFRP4E.Conditions.Ablaze" : "At the end of every Round, you suffer @Roll[1d10] Wounds, modified by Toughness Bonus and Armor Points on the least protected Hit Location, with a minimum of 1 Wound suffered.

Removing a Fatigued Condition normally requires rest, a spell, or a divine effect, though in some instances, such as when a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition is caused by carrying too much (see Encumbrance), simply changing your circumstances (carrying fewer trappings, for example) can remove a Condition.",

    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Malaise" :  "You don’t feel at all well. You are tired, find it hard to concentrate, and just generally ill. Take a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition that you can only remove when you have recovered from your illness. ",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Nausea" :  "You feel very sick and are prone to vomiting if you move around too quickly. Whenever you fail a Test involving physical movement, your nausea overwhelms you and you vomit. You gain the @Condition[Stunned] condition, which represents you being sick repeatedly or dry heaving, depending upon your current circumstances. ",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Pox" :  "You are covered in pustules, inﬂamed swellings, disgusting rashes, or itchy spots, which are unlikely to be your most attractive feature. Pox are largely a cosmetic issue, resulting in a penalty of –10 to Fellowship Tests. Additionally, remember to roleplay and describe all the scratching; if you want to withhold from this for a while, pass an <b>Average (+20) Cool</b> Test. When the Pox ends, attempt an <b>Average (+20) Cool</b> Test. If this fails, reverse the Test dice and apply permanent scarring to that Hit Location, showing an area where you scratched and the pox there healed badly. If the <a class='table-click' data-table = 'hitloc'><i class='fas fa-list'></i> Hit Location</a> is the head, permanently lose 1 in Fellowship.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Wounded" :  "You have a wound or open sore that does not heal properly because of an infection. For each Wounded symptom you have, you cannot heal one of your Wounds, which stays open and sore, possibly seeping foul-smelling pus. Every day, take an <b>Easy (+20) Endurance</b> Test or gain a Festering Wound if you do not already have one.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Delirium" :  "Your sensibility comes and goes, with moments of clarity replaced suddenly by bouts of raving, hallucinations, and terror. Make a <b>Challenging (+0) Willpower Test</b> each hour, and consult the @Table[delirium] table.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Swelling" : "A part of the body swells up to several times its normal size, turning an angry red or purple colour and becoming almost unusable. The affected body part is normally the location of a wound or bite causing the Swelling, or the point of contact where a disease or infection entered the body.<br><br><b>Head</b>: The eyes and tongue bulge, the cheeks become livid, the jaw is forced open. Eating is impossible, but clear liquids maybe sipped in small quantities. Any Tests requiring speech are 3 steps more Difficult.<br><b>Arm</b>:The arm and hand swell, the shoulder and elbow joints cannot move, and the hand becomes useless. For the duration, the arm counts as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.injuries.MnMZv7ZXoRqoH9dS]{Amputated}.<br><b>Body</b>: The entire body swells until the sufferer can no longer wear clothes. All Tests involving movement become 3 steps more Difficult.<br><b>Leg</b>: The leg swells grotesquely, becoming as wide as the widest part of the thigh for its entire length. The foot is almost indistingushable. For the duration, the leg counts as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.injuries.k00PimCWkff11IA0]{Amputated}.",

    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Buboes" :  "A successful Heal Test with Surgery can lance your buboes, removing the penalty. If the Test is failed, gain a Festering Wound. If your Buboes are lanced, make a <b>Difficult (–10) Endurance</b> Test once per day or more swell into place",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Convulsions" :  "Rare herbs and alchemical mixes can lessen this symptom for a day, bringing Severe down to Moderate, and Moderate down to standard convulsions. These can be created by any with the Trade (Apothecary) skill and access to the appropriate ingredients (which can cost upwards of 10 shillings or more per dose). The final medicine is Rare and usually genuine (80%), and can be bought for around 1 GC per dose from Apothecaries, putting it beyond the reach of most citizens of the Empire.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.CoughsandSneezes" :  "None that work",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Fever" :  "There are many common, often disgusting, remedies for a fever, most of which don’t work (only 10% of commercial cures are genuine). A successful Heal Test does little more that inform you how long the fever will likely last. The cures range from a few pennies to many shillings in cost. If genuine, they will remove the symptoms of a Fever (not a severe one) if you pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Flux" :  "Real cures for the Flux are rare (10% of commercial remedies are genuine), but many apothecaries and herbalists swear theirs work every time. Costs vary widely according to where you buy the cures, from a few brass coins to small bag of silver. If genuine, the Flux can be held off for your Toughness Bonus in hours by taking a remedy.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Gangrene" :  "Amputation of the gangrenous location is the only effective treatment.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Lingering" :  "Cures for lingering infections are commonplace and usually relatively cheap, rarely costing more than a shilling. However, almost all are fake or based on faulty lore. Any bought cure has only a 10% chance of being genuine, but if so will negate the need to roll the Endurance Test if taken on the correct day (which will require a successful Heal Test to determine).",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Malaise" :  "Medicine treating Malaise, costing anything from a few pence to a handful of silver, is usually genuine (75% chance); and, if so, pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test to ignore the symptom for the day.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Nausea" :  "Remedies for Nausea are Common and usually genuine (60% chance), and typically cost around thirty pennies; if genuine, pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test, and the Nausea can be ignored for a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Pox" :  "Poxes are exceedingly common, and so are remedies, which are usually creams or oils. Larger temples of Shallya often keep a stock of the cream for free (though donations are expected) and apothecaries and herbalists of all kinds sell similar products for relatively low prices (rarely more than six or seven pence for a week’s worth of treatment, with a 90% chance of being genuine medicine). Using a cream increases all Cool Tests to resist scratching to <b>Very Easy (+40)</b>, but is usually unsightly.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Wounded" :  "A daily successful Heal Test ensures the Wound is clean and does not require an Endurance Test to be further infected.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Delirium" :  "Some authorities treat delirium as part of a fever, prescribing the same measures.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Swelling" : "Most treatments involve plunging the affected part, or sometimes the whole body, into an ice-water bath to reduce the heat that accompanies the swellings. An Extended <b>Hard (-20) Heal Test</b> requiring +3 SL reduces the swelling by <b>@Roll[2d10]</b> hours. Each Test takes an hour. The patient is left with +1 Fatigued Condition for every Test made in the process.<br><br>Some physicians instead bleed the patient with a blade or leeches. A successful <b>Extended Heal Test</b> requiring +4 SL and Trade Tools (Physician) reduces the swelling by (@Roll[1d10] + the patient's Toughness Bonus) hours.
