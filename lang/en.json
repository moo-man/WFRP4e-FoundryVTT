If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your primary arm location using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.",

For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test and the target number was 52 you can choose to use the SL, which in this case is 2, or the units die result, which is 4. An Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging takes precedent).",

When Entangling an opponent, you cannot otherwise use the weapon to hit. You can end the Entangling whenever you wish.",

A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence, either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other) as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes precedent).",

    "WFRP4E.Properties.Impact" : "Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their weight or design. On a successful hit, add the result of the units die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon. An Undamaging weapon can never also have Impact (Undamaging takes precedent).",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Impale" : "Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under an appropriate Test in combat. If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body. Arrows and bolts require a successful Challenging (+0) Heal Test to remove — bullets require a surgeon (see the Surgery Talent in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each unremoved arrow or bullet.",

    "WFRP4E.Properties.Pummel" : "Pummel weapons are especially good at battering foes into submission. If you score a Head hit with a Pummel weapon, attempt an Opposed Strength/ Endurance test against the struck opponent. If you win the test, your opponent gains a Stunned Condition.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Repeater" : "Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after each time you fire. When you use all your shots, you must fully reload the weapon using the normal rules.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Shield" : "If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body. If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2 or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your Line of Sight.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Trapblade" : "Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead of causing a Critical Hit. If you choose to do this, enact an Opposed Strength Test, adding your SL from the previous Melee Test. If you succeed, your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the blade and may fight on as normal.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Unbreakable" : "The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an especially strong material. Under almost all circumstances, this weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Wrap" : "Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Flexible" : "Flexible armor can be worn under a layer of non-Flexible armor if you wish. If you do so, you gain the benefit of both.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Impenetrable" : "The armor is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply cannot penetrate it. All Critical Wounds caused by an odd number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Durable" : "Laboriously crafted using strong materials, the item can take +Durable Damage points before it suﬀers any negatives and gains a saving throw of 9+ on a <a class = 'chat-roll'><i class='fas fa-dice'></i> 1d10</a> roll against instant breakage from sources like Trap Blade. This Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Fine" : "Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of social status and can be taken multiple times. The higher the quality, the more impressive it seems.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Lightweight" : "Cleverly crafted for ease of carrying. Reduce Encumbrance points by 1.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Practical" : "Expertly crafted with utility in mind. A failed test using this item receives +1 SL. If the item is a piece of armor, any penalties for wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from -30 to -20).",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Dangerous" : "Some weapons are almost as likely to hurt you as your opponent. Any failed test including a 9 on either 10s or units die results in a Fumble.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Imprecise" : "Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise (Imprecise takes precedent).",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Reload" : "The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while reloading, you must start again from scratch.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Slow" : "Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attack",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Tiring" : "The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits on a Turn you Charge.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This changes the Damage shown in the chat card:<br> 'Not Charging' | 'Charging' Damage.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Undamaging" : "Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit in combat.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Partial" : "The armor does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores the partial armor’s APs.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Weakpoints" : "The armor has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky. If your opponent has a weapon with the Impale Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of your armor are ignored.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Ugly" : "Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suﬀer a –10 penalty.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Shoddy" : "Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster. The item breaks when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy armor breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location it protects.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Unreliable" : "Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armor are doubled.",
    "WFRP4E.Properties.Bulky" : "An awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this ﬂaw). Bulky clothing and armor are Enc 1 even when worn, and Fatigue penalties for armor are doubled.",

Any ranged combat hit automatically does the same if the shooter is at Point Blank range.<br><br>The Unconscious Condition does not stack — you are either Unconscious, or you are not — so you do not collect multiple Unconscious Conditions.<br><br>Recovering from unconsciousness requires diﬀerent circumstances depending upon why you fell unconscious. Refer to Injury for more on this. If you spend a Resolve point to remove an Unconscious condition, but have not resolved the cause of the incapacitation, you gain another Unconscious Condition at the end of the round. When you lose the Unconscious Condition, you gain the <a class='condition-chat'><i class='fas fa-user-injured'></i> Prone</a> and <a class='condition-chat'><i class='fas fa-user-injured'></i> Fatigued</a> Conditions",
    "WFRP4E.Conditions.Grappling" : "If you begin your turn Grappling, you may break the Grapple if you have a higher Advantage than your opponent, and do not count as being Engaged for your Move; otherwise, you must make an Opposed Strength Test for your Action. If you win, you can do one of the following:<br><ul><li>Deal SB + SL Damage using your Strength roll to determine the Hit Location affected. You ignore any Armour Points as you wrench arms and pull muscles.</li><li>Either: 1) Give your opponent an <a class='condition-chat'><i class='fas fa-user-injured'></i> Entangled</a> Condition, or 2) Remove an <a class='condition-chat'><i class='fas fa-user-injured'></i> Entangled</a> Condition from yourself, plus lose an extra one for each SL by which you win</li></ul>",
    "WFRP4E.Conditions.Fear" : "When subject to Fear, you suffer –1 SL on all Tests to affect the source of your fear. You may not move closer to whatever is causing Fear without passing a <b>Challenging (+0) Cool</b> Test.

If Blight is marked as (Moderate), this Test is <b>Easy (+30)</b>; if marked as (Severe), this Test is <b>Average (+20)</b>.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Buboes" :  "You have huge swellings of the lymph nodes, possibly in the groin, neck or armpits. These are enormously painful and may bleed or seep pus. They are disgusting, smelly, and some would argue a sure sign of the Lord of Pestilence’s favor, believing they hide tiny, growing Daemons. Common practice is to lance these terrible expressions of taint to remove whatever nestles within, though doing so often results in Festering Wounds.\n\nSuffer a penalty of –10 to all physical Tests, and to all Fellowship Tests if the buboes can be seen (or smelled!).",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Convulsions" :  "Your body periodically spasms or shakes as the infection seemingly uses you like a puppet.\n\nSuffer a penalty of –10 to all physical Tests as your body convulses beyond your control.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Flux" :  "There’s a rumble and a grumble, then you’re oﬀ for yet another sprint to the splattered outhouse. Pale and weary, you’ve had better days. Any given situation may be the moment you just have to go to the privy. You are expected to take every opportunity you can to pop oﬀ for an essential stop, and this is largely left in your hands. In addition, the GM can choose any point during the session’s play to claim you need to go. You have a number of rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus to get to an appropriate place to relieve yourself; whether you get there in time or not, your body will empty itself in a spectacular fashion. If the Flux is marked as (Moderate), the GM can make you go twice a session. If it is marked as (Severe), the GM can do it three times, and you will also lose 1 Wound per visit, as the bloody ﬂux leaves you utterly drained. ",

If you ever fail more times than you have Toughness Bonus, you completely lose all capability with the aﬀected location. If this occurs, use the same rules as Amputated Parts. For as long as you have Gangrene, suﬀer a penalty –10 to all Fellowship Tests, and suﬀer the Wounded symptom. Further, if not already suffering it, you also suﬀer from Blight until the aﬀected tissue is amputated; this remains even if you are cured of the disease that started the Gangrene. ",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Lingering" :  "You have an infection that just refuses to go away. Indeed, you fear it may be getting worse… After your disease reaches the end of its duration, attempt an Endurance Test with the Difficulty marked on the symptom like so: Lingering (Average) or Lingering (Easy). If this scores a Marginal Failure (0), the duration extends for an extra <a class = 'chat-roll'><i class='fas fa-dice'></i> 1d10</a> days. If it scores a Failure (–2), develop a Festering Wound.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Nausea" :  "You feel very sick and are prone to vomiting if you move around too quickly. Whenever you fail a Test involving physical movement, your nausea overwhelms you and you vomit.

",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Pox" :  "You are covered in pustules, inﬂamed swellings, disgusting rashes, or itchy spots, which are unlikely to be your most attractive feature. Pox are largely a cosmetic issue, resulting in a penalty of –10 to Fellowship Tests. Additionally, remember to roleplay and describe all the scratching; if you want to withhold from this for a while, pass an <b>Average (+20) Cool</b> Test. When the Pox ends, attempt an <b>Average (+20) Cool</b> Test.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Wounded" :  "You have a wound or open sore that does not heal properly because of an infection. For each Wounded symptom you have, you cannot heal one of your Wounds, which stays open and sore, possibly seeping foul-smelling pus.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomDescriptions.Swelling" : "A part of the body swells up to several times its normal size, turning an angry red or purple colour and becoming almost unusable. The affected body part is normally the location of a wound or bite causing the Swelling, or the point of contact where a disease or infection entered the body.<br><br><b>Head</b>: The eyes and tongue bulge, the cheeks become livid, the jaw is forced open. Eating is impossible, but clear liquids maybe sipped in small quantities. Any Tests requiring speech are 3 steps more Difficult.<br><b>Arm</b>:The arm and hand swell, the shoulder and elbow joints cannot move, and the hand becomes useless. For the duration, the arm counts as Amputated (WFRP, page 180).<br><b>Body</b>: The entire body swells until the sufferer can no longer wear clothes. All Tests involving movement become 3 steps more Difficult.<br><b>Leg</b>: The leg swells grotesquely, becoming as wide as the widest part of the thigh for its entire length.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Convulsions" :  "Rare herbs and alchemical mixes can lessen this symptom for a day, bringing Severe down to Moderate, and Moderate down to standard convulsions. These can be created by any with the Trade (Apothecary) skill and access to the appropriate ingredients (which can cost upwards of 10 shillings or more per dose). The final medicine is Rare and usually genuine (80%), and can be bought for around 1 GC per dose from Apothecaries, putting it beyond the reach of most citizens of the Empire.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.CoughsandSneezes" :  "None that work",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Fever" :  "There are many common, often disgusting, remedies for a fever, most of which don’t work (only 10% of commercial cures are genuine). A successful Heal Test does little more that inform you how long the fever will likely last. The cures range from a few pennies to many shillings in cost. If genuine, they will remove the symptoms of a Fever (not a severe one) if you pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Flux" :  "Real cures for the Flux are rare (10% of commercial remedies are genuine), but many apothecaries and herbalists swear theirs work every time.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Gangrene" :  "Amputation of the gangrenous location is the only effective treatment.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Lingering" :  "Cures for lingering infections are commonplace and usually relatively cheap, rarely costing more than a shilling. However, almost all are fake or based on faulty lore. Any bought cure has only a 10% chance of being genuine, but if so will negate the need to roll the Endurance Test if taken on the correct day (which will require a successful Heal Test to determine).",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Malaise" :  "Medicine treating Malaise, costing anything from a few pence to a handful of silver, is usually genuine (75% chance); and, if so, pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test to ignore the symptom for the day.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Nausea" :  "Remedies for Nausea are Common and usually genuine (60% chance), and typically cost around thirty pennies; if genuine, pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test, and the Nausea can be ignored for a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Pox" :  "Poxes are exceedingly common, and so are remedies, which are usually creams or oils. Larger temples of Shallya often keep a stock of the cream for free (though donations are expected) and apothecaries and herbalists of all kinds sell similar products for relatively low prices (rarely more than six or seven pence for a week’s worth of treatment, with a 90% chance of being genuine medicine). Using a cream increases all Cool Tests to resist scratching to <b>Very Easy (+40)</b>, but is usually unsightly.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Wounded" :  "A daily successful Heal Test ensures the Wound is clean and does not require an Endurance Test to be further infected.",
    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Delirium" :  "Some authorities treat delirium as part of a fever, prescribing the same measures.

    "WFRP4E.SymptomTreatment.Swelling" : "Most treatments involve plunging the affected part, or sometimes the whole body, into an ice-water bath to reduce the heat that accompanies the swellings.
